"Desktop","1","review","0",,"My family & I ended up spending 1 of my only 2 vacation days stuck in Detroit airport because airline didn't have crew to load baggage on the plane in Syr. It is difficult to accept that we sat in the plane for 2 1/2 hrs due to this lack of support. The delay caused me and my family to miss a connecting flight which is bad enough. Then, even though the company could have connected us on an earlier flight on a different carrier, Delta preferred to rebook us to their own flight due to corporate policy, even though it was 4 hours more for us to sit in the airport. So that means Delta gets to keep the money and we get to spend the day here - at an airport terminal.
To improve: Where to start... (1) Hire enough people to do the job? Having trouble getting people to load baggage at 4am in the snow and rain? Perhaps you need to offer more than minimum wage for that ""Ramp Crew"" job that I see posted. (2) Put your customers first instead of corporate profits. Don't make a family spend the day at an airport when you can get them to their destination 4 hours earlier OR (3) How about simply not loading the plane full of people when you know you can't take off! I can't help but imagine that ""loading the plane ontime"" helps some sort of corporate statistic. That really sucks for real people. You should try it sometime. Not a fun adventure.","Vacation day spent in Detroit Airport due lack of ""Ramp Crew""","false","false"
"Desktop","1","review","0",,"On a recent Delta flight from Los Angeles to Aspen, passengers experienced an egregious level of poor service upon arrival. The frustration began as the aircraft taxied to its final deplaning area, only to find no ground personnel available to direct the plane. Passengers were left stranded onboard for a baffling 15 minutes, waiting for assistance that never seemed to materialize. This lack of coordination and foresight left travelers feeling disregarded and inconvenienced.

As if the initial delay wasn't enough, the ordeal continued when it came time to retrieve luggage. Despite Aspen's relatively low traffic volume, with only four planes arriving daily, passengers were left dumbfounded as they waited an additional 20 minutes for their bags to be offloaded. Such an extended delay in a destination with minimal air traffic is simply inexcusable and indicative of a systemic failure in Delta's service operations.

The absence of ground personnel and the prolonged wait for baggage retrieval underscore a concerning disregard for customer satisfaction and basic operational efficiency. Passengers, many of whom may have been eager to begin their Aspen adventures or simply return home after a long journey, were left feeling frustrated and disillusioned by the airline's lackluster performance.

Delta Air Lines, a reputable carrier known for its commitment to customer service, must address these glaring deficiencies promptly. Failure to do so risks not only alienating loyal patrons but also tarnishing the airline's hard-earned reputation for reliability and quality. In an industry where competition is fierce and customer expectations are high, such lapses in service can have far-reaching consequences. It is imperative that Delta takes swift and decisive action to rectify these issues and restore faith in its ability to deliver a superior travel experience.","Poor service","false","false"

They allowed us to board the plane first (as I had my wedding dress as my carry on item), and the flight attendants went above and BEYOND... the ladies showed me an overhead bin where I could store my dress and then shut it so that no one else could store bags in there, ensuring it would be kept safe and free of wrinkles.

My flight on May 10 was a one stop flight, with 2 hour layover in atlanta, going on to Detroit.  Total flight time approximately 8 hours.  The only options they had for me was to reroute to Mexico City, spend 8 hours overnight, and then fly out the next day to Detroit.(Essentially 26 hour travel time)  I informed them because of a commitment on the 11th I needed to get home on the 10th, and luckily for me on January 27th I made a reservation with them, which they accepted and took my money, to get me home on the evening of the 10th.  However, after hours of calls, supervisor escalations, etc. they said if they need to cancel flights for ""Operational management"" reasons their ""Contract of Carriage"" allowed them to do that, and unfortunately I had two options:  1) Take what they were offering which would require me to go and stay in Mexico City and get home a day late or 2) cancel my flight and make alternate travel arrangements.  ( Basically the Tough $#*t card)  My expectation was since they ""electively"" cancelled the flight they should have got me a comparable scheduled flight that gets me home on the 10th, and there was an available American Airlines flight.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"I was quite disappointed on a recent trip using Delta airlines.  When I arrived at the gate in Detroit two Delta agents were assisting customers.  One of them was very unprofessional in both his demeanor and body language; putting off an attitude that he did not want to be there.  The second (and bigger) issue was carry on luggage.  When I purchased my ticket with Delta, my ticket included one carry on luggage and one personal item.  On both my departure flight and my arrival flight my husband and I were both told we must check our carry on due to running out of overhead bin space on the plane.  Both times when we entered the plane, there was plenty (quite a bit to be honest) of overhead bin space.  In fact, I witnessed the flight attendant closing partially filled overhead bins as I walked down the aisle.  When I asked a flight attendant about this on my return flight, he said ""they only fill their overhead bins 70%."" To me this is a deceptive business practice; to tell customers you can have one carry on and one personal item when you purchase your ticket, but then are told you MUST check it at the gate.  The purpose of a carry on is to keep your bag with you. Is this a ploy to get customers to upgrade so they arent in the last 30% that get told they cant bring their carry on with them? The last issue was a very rude flight attendant on my return flight,  who was both unprofessional and lacked the customer service skills needed for her line of work.

But this is now the second consecutive time that they changed the plane, a day or so before our flight, which changed the seating configuration. The original plane was an Airbus that went to a Boeing 737. We were not notified of this change with the option to change seat locations. Delta kept us in the same seat numbers, however we went from an exit row with two seats to a middle and a window seat. We NEVER book these seats - we will book two aisle seats.  We purchase flights at least nine (9) months early to select specific seat locations.  If Delta is going to change planes which in turn change seat locations, the least that they can do is put passengers back in the same location that they purchased.  Delta agents at the gate simple said that they had nothing to do with this and that the plane is full.  We could have waited to see if another flight had available exit row seats - yah right!

Lately they have been shamelessly riding on their reputation.

A couple weeks ago, we tried to go to Cancun from Salt Lake City via Atlanta with plenty of time to spare for our connecting flight.
Only problem is that the departing flight was not a few minutes late but hours late! The Delta desk attendant told us the plane had mechanical issues.
Since this massive delay would have caused us to miss our connecting flight in Atlanta, we had to rebook our flight for the next day, pretty much ruining our trip.

We tried to get a refund for the first night at the hotel which we had to forfeit, and Delta is now telling us they cannot refund us because the room was pre-paid! Of course, we had to reserve that hotel ahead of time. The arrogance of that airline is just limitless.

Finally, we were able to check the historical data on that specific flight (you can get this data from several sites such as Flightradar24), and it turned out that this Delta flight has been either delayed or cancelled 5 times over 10 days from February 1st through February 10th, including our flight.
So, this seems to be a systemic issue with delta's plane maintenance and management. In fact, the attendant we talked to encouraged us to rebook the trip as a direct flight telling us that Atlanta was experiencing lots of maintenance problems. Nice to know, and not very comforting ;(
I will not make any speculation about the risk level that Delta might be exposing its customers to, but when an airplane keeps being delayed (and in one instance cancelled), this is something everyone should be concerned about. At least this should be brought up and questioned.

At this point we have decided to totally stop using Delta. Other airlines are now much better at better prices.","Discount Airline at premium price","false","false"

I had a short trip from Chicago to LaGuardia NY on February 5th. 
I visited 82 countries and I never had any issues during my flight. 
I was the last passenger on the board, before I entered to the plane. 
The flight attendant Kimberly was extremely rude, demanding to me that must check your bag. 
The other flight attendant “her colleague” said we have a lot of space on the back no need the carryon bag to be check in. 
Kimberly chose to be rude and insulting me by saying “If you don’t check your carry on bag you must leave”.
I tried to explain to her can you please listen to your colleague since she is saying you have space on the back. 
This bag it’s very valuable, a present from my parents and cost a lot to me. 
The flight attendant took my boarding pass and look at me by saying you can’t fly with an expensive carry on bag and purchase an economy ticket. 
You have no choice you are flying or leaving. Her tone was very unprofessional and very high. 
I felt so embarrassed on front on the passengers on front of the seats. She chose to increase her voice and use inappropriate language towards me. 
I felt so embarrassed and I had no choice I entered the plane and they took my bag. 
When I arrived to my seat I saw so empty space. 
The other flight attendant only apologized to me by saying I understand your frustration since she did not even listen even to her. 
I was treated as a not valued customer, insulted and embarrassed on front of the other passengers. 
If this happened to me can happen to anyone. This must be address and resolved.

I had a flight with LATAM from Sao Paulo to Lisbon connecting DELTA from Lisbon from Boston due to issues at the airport in SP. 
When I arrived in Lisbon, the DELTA STAFF, their own staff, called all the LATAM passengers to double check the luggage tickets. I was GUARANTEED by a DELTA AGENT they had both of my luggages and my baby' stroller. When I arrived in Boston, but luggages where no where to be found. 3 days later I received the first luggage that was found in Sao Paulo, a week later a received the second luggage also found in Sao Paulo. Then I received a message on my phone from someone at the Sao Paulo airport who saw my tel number and email attached to the stroller saying they found the stroller LOST at the airport with no tag and was going to redirect it to Delta. I reached out to DELTA to get a compensation for their mishandling and also false information as clearly the Delta Agent inLisbon had no idea what he was talking about it. 
After investigation, I got a message saying the reason I am not eligible for refund is because I paid the luggages to LATAM.

I was inconvenienced with a delayed flight which caused my connecting flight arrival to be delayed. While my first flight landed 10 minutes prior to my connecting flights departure, it was due to do lack of Delta peer communication I would not get home until 5:30pm the next day. It was disappointing to experience a lack or empathy or understanding from the staff members. This experience included attitude, lack of urgency, overall carelessness to the customers experience in a time of difficulty. 

Delta prides themselves quoting “Delta Air Lines intends to ensure that your air travel experience will encompass, to the best of our abilities, the most comprehensive customer service possible.” - Delta Customer Commitment which they have failed to uphold in my experience. 

The second commitment Delta failed to withhold was Commitment #2 “Notifying consumers of known delays, cancellations, and diversions”. This was not upheld as I was not aware I would be penalised for lack of gate communication in the event of Delta airline delays. 

The third failed commitment and the most notable “Identifying the services Delta provides to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from delays, cancellations, and misconnects”. According to this policy which DOES NOT DETAILED A EXCLUSION FOR ATC. “When a delay, misconnect, or cancellation is within Delta’s control, we will:
* Provide complimentary hotel accommodations at Delta-contracted facilities, based on availability, as well as complimentary ground transportation to and from the hotel, if you are inconvenienced overnight while away from your home or destination. If a Delta-contracted hotel accommodation is unavailable and you book your own accommodations while inconvenienced overnight away from your home or destination, Delta will reimburse reasonable costs for your hotel room and ground transportation to and from the hotel. If accommodations are unavailable, we will compensate you with a credit commensurate in value with the Delta-contracted hotel rate.
* Provide a meal or meal vouchers, if a cancellation or delay results in waiting 3 or more hours beyond the scheduled departure time.”

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"The Delta Airlines customer service. 3D’s. 
Dysfunction and disinterest followed by dismissiveness. A corporate culture generally reserved for cattle.

I’m in my 60’s and recently retired. Always figured I’d travel the World a bit and recently flew Delta in premium economy to Australia from Los Angeles. To start, I was eyeing an economy ticket at a little over $1,500 which seemed reasonable but everyone I talked to who’d been said the 16-hour trip was a killer and at 6’ 2” and way less bendy than I used to be, I’d be far better off in a premium economy seat. Those were almost $4,000, however. Anyway, after a lot of thought, I decided to get the premium seat by using nearly all the American Express miles I’d collected since becoming a member in 1984. It took 370,000 of them! 

To cut to the chase. The outgoing flight was ok. It’s long but the seat was roomier and comfortable. The cabin attendants excellent. The food was a bit odd and came in flimsy brown cardboard, (I imagine recyclable) tubs. Those were challenging since it was a bit of a race to consume the food before the containers dissolved in your lap. 

The flight back, however, was an absolute nightmare.
First, it was completely booked. Jam-packed. No issue there but the seat I was assigned was in terrible shape. Not only was it old, worn, and dirty. It was also defective. After takeoff, it only reclined after one of the attendants gave it a surprisingly vicious shove. This, however, appeared to upset it, and for the rest of the flight, it repeatedly extended the lower footrest by itself. I’d tried the footrest option on the way out but, (clearly designed for much shorter people), it pushed my knees up into ear warmers. Anyway, this, now rogue device would slowly extend by itself, pinning the backs of my legs to the seat in front. I’d drift off a bit only to start dreaming I was being attacked by a saltwater crocodile. Jokes aside it was painful. No matter what the attendants tried to do, there was little I could do other than carefully extricate my legs, (think scrapes, chaffing, and the auto removal of socks), then, with their encouragement, stamp it back into place. Various suggestions were made to try and keep it from repeating its inexecrable extension to no avail. Wedging blankets, pillows, and even water bottles between it and the floor were all defeated. As a result, I spent most of the flight walking the aisle since there were apparently no other seats available at all. None. After 14 or so hours I’d have been happy sitting on a toilet, but they were all so busy as to suggest that would only add insult to injury.

The purser (very nice) made a complaint on a tablet for me. At the same time letting me know that he was aware of my seat’s misbehavior and that several seats on that plane had already been flagged as having issues but none had yet to be serviced/replaced.

Ok so, again cutting to the chase. I heard nothing, so I complained online. I rapidly received a scripted, platitude laden auto response/ apology and told that 5000 miles had been credited to my account. FIVE THOUSAND MILES. That’s less than one and a half percent of the mileage cost of the flight. Talk about a bone. Anyway, it felt like a slap in the face. A kiss off and so I wrote to them again. I basically explained and clarified this wasn’t about a malfunctioning earbud. It was a serious issue that had me unable to sit, relax, snooze or sleep for ALMOST 14 HOURS.   

This is what they (or more likely AI) wrote in response.

“We do appreciate your persistence regarding this matter. As you requested, I have again reviewed the matter to see if I overlooked anything that might support a more favorable conclusion. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can add to what has already been stated in our previous correspondence. I am sorry we aren't able to resolve this matter to your satisfaction. Any further communication would not be productive and we will not respond again regarding this issue.”

Wow. Ok then, (Baa / Moo). I’ll just limp back to my pen/corral. My conclusion? Don’t fly Delta. It sucks. As does their corporate, kleptocratic culture of profiteering. A wretched, avaricious pursuit of profit. Free of any sense of culpability, common sense, or decency. Money over literally everything, anything, and very sadly, anyone.

We had booked flights for our honeymoon from ICT to ATL to UVF. Our first flight out of Wichita was delayed and they told us it was due to the plane sitting overnight and they did not drain the water system and pipes were frozen. They put us on 10 minute updates for the pipes to thaw after two hours they decided to deboard us and the plane would still be departing just further delayed. Due to this delay, we had already missed our flight out of Atlanta to St. Lucia and there is only one flight a day. They had told us the flight was canceled due to mechanical issues, and they would take care of whatever they could. We were booked for the flight the next day out of ATL and were told they would get us to Atlanta and comp us a hotel. After waiting several hours they finally cancelled the flight and reiterated it was due to mechanical issues and said there were no more flights to Atlanta that day. We ended up having to be driven to Oklahoma City (5 hours round trip) to catch a flight to Atlanta.

In Atlanta, we went to the customer service desk and told them that we were promised a hotel. The gentleman at the desk advised us his shift was over and we would have to wait 2 to 3 hours for the next shift to come in even though he just got done helping someone else. He then directed us to somebody else and we told them the same story and he said that he didn’t know what to tell us, but he couldn’t get us a hotel room. He then stated that our flight was delayed due to weather and they do not offer any compensation for whether delays. We advised him that our flight was canceled due to mechanical issues, and that we were told we would be compensated. He then, very rudely told us that our flight was not due to mechanical issues, and that it was due to weather. We told him that we were promised a hotel and he said well that is false, incorrect, and should book our own hotel at 12:30am. We ended up having to stay overnight in the airport.

Due to these delays, we had to reschedule our reservation and extend a day so we had to change our flights returning, which were also overnight . We were also told we would be given a hotel by another employee since the delay ultimately impacted our return flights as well. We were also never given that hotel.

I have since reached out to Delta asking for either compensation or a refund for the hotel. We ended up getting ourselves and they said they can offer no compensation because it was a leather delay and not mechanical issues. 

Our travel experience with Delta Air Lines we were extremely misled, lied to, and disrespected by several staff and flight members. After dealing with them, they are extremely unethical, unprofessional and have very poor customer service. We will not be flying with them ever again.","Delta Sucks","false","false"
"Desktop","2","review","0",,"Traveling from Houston to Appleton, WI I had a connection in Minneapolis. Upon landing I saw online my flight was delayed an hour due to a delay on the inbound aircraft from Ohio. Departure was estimated at 3:18pm (originally 2:20 ).  When the aircraft arrived, the gate agent announced that after cleaning, etc, we could board the aircraft. A few minutes later, the gate agent announced that no, we had to wait even longer because a new crew was needed, and that would take until around 4 pm, so a new departure estimate was set for 4:45pm. (The electronic sign in the departure lounge said the departure was 4:45 and arrival would be 4:18 !!! Apparently the flight would travel back in time:)  )  A while later we were told the crew would now arrive not at 4, but at 5:02pm. More waiting. Crew finally rolls up at 5:30.  Gate agent announces then that we were all given electronic vouchers for $15 for a meal (as compensation for their incompetence) BUT THAT WE SHOULD NOT TRY TO USE THE VOUCHER FOR A MEAL AT THAT TIME BECAUSE WE WOULD BE BOARDING SOON! Finally boarded and pushed back from the gate, only to sit on tarmac for another 25 minutes because some type of tower clearance had had expired because of the long delay, and they had to await new approval for departure!  

So after 4 hours of “any minute now we’ll depart” we took off at 6:30.

Why didn’t they source a new crew as soon as they knew the inbound flight from Ohio would be delayed???
Why didn’t they sort out the bureaucratic issue with the tower ahead of time so we could take off right after boarding???

"Desktop","4","review","0",,"I flew for the first time on first class domestically for which I actually paid for the ticket as opposed to have been upgraded by the airline.  At the last minute, literally a few hours before the flight, I had to buy the ticket, and first class was what was available to go on Delta from Jacksonville to Seattle with a change in Atlanta.

I paid nearly USD2,300 to travel the one way distance, both on Boeing 737-900 aircraft, which looked clean and brigh.  Here is my review.

The seats were comfortable with head wings, ample leg space, back seat pockets to stash your small item belongings, power plug sockets, and sufficient overhead bins where I easily placed my carryon small suitcase, a backpack and winter jacket.  These planes came with a TV screen at the back of the seats.  An impressive selection of channels including those of news and sports organizations, in addition to movies and TV shows, were available for viewing.  I could also track the flight path of the plane along with all the metrics about speed, height, temperature, and time to arrival and time at destination.  The seat had. a clear cellophane wrapped package — containing a blanked and a pillow. — when I boarded.  I did not use the pillow; I draped my laps and legs with the thin fleece-like throw.

As a first class passenger, I was able to board in Group 1.  The first class cabin held 20 seats in a 2 by 2 configuration.  I had a window seat.  All the seats were taken.  The gap between the two side by side seats was ample to give a comfortable sense of space separateness — there was no way passengers  could rub shoulders even if we wanted to!

Inexpensive earphones were provided — complimentary.  They worked fine and I followed the coverage and results of the Iowa Republican Party caucus (probably even as we flew over the Hawkeye State!) for the duration of the journey.

A selection of beverages include wine, beer, and spirits were offered.  I tried a red wine, which came in a glass goblet, and was refilled.  A basket tray with snack packs was passed around once — a mix of sweet and savory items.

The transfer in ATL was manageable — it required taking the train to the next terminal.  But the crowds were immense and the eating places were jammed with people, many waiting in line.  I could not take advantage of it given the time for connection and believing that food would be served on the flight.

The best part of this trip was that both flights were punctual — they left and arrived on schedule.

The flight attendants were pleasant, polite, and did their jobs.  I paid attention to their safety instructions which were matched by a catchy video demonstration.

The ATL-SEA flight was long, over five hours.  It had been preceded by about a 90 minute flight from JAX.

The worst part was there was no meal service in first class.  The flight attendant expressed her regret that there wasn’t any food when I asked her.   I enquired if there was any food for purchase.  She returned to inform me of two choices — boxes containing various snack pieces.  I chose one of them.  She did not take the payment I offered, probably realizing that it did not make sense to charge a first class passenger for a box of crackers, cheese, and a small piece of beef jerky while providing free liquor!

Given the lateness of the hour, the cabin was dark, except for the glow of TV screens, and quiet.  The lavatories were kept tidy.

Overall, I have nothing to complain.  I reached Seattle on schedule, but close to midnight, with not a shop or restaurant open in the terminal.  I am glad I was able to get that box of snacks on the plane.  Otherwise I would have gone really hungry.

I arrived at CPR around 4:30am for a 5:55am flight. I had already checked in online and had already printed boarding passes, but did have one bag to check and that process was completed in a very timely manner. We then cleared security and headed to the gate area to wait for the boarding process to begin. I knew we might be the last to board, as we airfare, as part of a package and ended up in basic economy. My mom however requires a little extra time to board, so she boarded early. That being said the boarding process did not start until closer 5:50am and this worried me, as I knew we would have to have our plane de-iced before taking off (temps were below zero) and suspected that we might arrive at SLC late. This late arrival thus could cause a missed connection (more on this later). After boarding we then sat at the gate for 5 or 10 minutes with no communication from the flight crew. We then moved to a de-icing area with still no communication from the flight crew for several minutes (finally told we were just waiting for the de-icing truck). After another 5 minutes said truck did show up and sprayed our plane multiple times. While I see this process as necessary safety procedure I felt it did not even start in a timely manner. That being said I felt bad for the person spraying the deicer in cold temps. All of this meant that we did not depart until around 7am and arrived at around 8:10am.

- Cancellations
- Delays
- Poor clarity in Customer Service
- No wifi on the plane
- Assigning a smaller plane model for a trans-Atlantic flight which was a sandwich-fest!

Every single flight on my journey had issues. From seat changes, no wifi, major delays and eventually a cancellation, causing us to stay overnight at JFK.

A total of around 24hours flight time. Instead, you can go with KLM if from Europe, and get to Rio in less than half that time, for cheaper, and much more comfortable.

We got to the airport at 9am and our flight got cancelled, which I understand is not anyone’s fault. Our original flight was set to fly out at 11am. My brother had a large suitcase that needed to be checked and the delta agent told us we couldn’t check it until about 6 hours before hand. Which during said time was in 4 hours. So, we continue to go through to security and everything was fine. Then 7 hours later when we go to board the flight. The ladies at the front desk were like omg that bag is too big why didn’t you check it before? And keep in mind everyone that needs to board the plane besides first class was waiting and listening to our whole situation because they were being so loud. And this is not me being over dramatic, i never leave reviews. They were being loud in a sense like trying to call us out and catch us in some sort of lie or get us in trouble it was very odd. So then we explain our whole situation calmly and one of the ladies who wasn’t part of the conversation says “did y’all miss your flight?” Did I say that?? No. So I said “no it got cancelled the second we walked into the airport and immediately rebooked.” Then she (lady not in our conversation) continued to say well that’s TSA agents telling y’all that and I’m like no it was actually your co worker the delta agent we were specifically told we were not aloud to check the bag and we could check it once we board at the gate. And they all were quiet lost and confused. And then she was like next time you need to just check your bag and I was like ?????? And I was like you guys should communicate better because this is clearly a misunderstanding between staff. Which i don’t even know why this was an issue to begin with just check the bag….. anyways the attitude was very unappreciated. Also just wanted to add that one of the flight attendants on the flight once we got on proceeded to be slightly ignorant. So we were having friendly conversation with him and then we had asked if our brother could sit next to us because he was sitting alone and we were all the way in the last row of the flight with empty seats near us.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I have been a loyal Delta customer, often traveling with my husband who holds Silver and Platinum status. However, my recent experience on flight DL1667 has left me deeply disappointed. Despite being a frequent flyer, I encountered a distressing incident involving flight attendant Fatima, who seemed to selectively target my AWAY carryon for checking. Her abrupt and rude response to my genuine confusion over the matter raised concerns about the abuse of power.
Recording the encounter, I was shocked by the lack of consistency in the responses from Lead Flight Attendant Nikki and Fatima. The subsequent request to leave the plane by an unnamed woman, without explanation or courtesy, added to the distress. Seeking guidance from Delta customer service, the captain's involvement resulted in my removal from the flight based on Fatima's claim of feeling unsafe with me on board.
This incident, triggered by a simple issue of how my carryon was placed, calls into question the professionalism and judgment of Delta's staff. The subsequent delay and inconvenience of being rebooked on a later flight only deepened my disappointment. As someone who has positively contributed to Delta's image through influencer content, I cannot help but wonder if my experience would have been different if I were of a different race.
In conclusion, I am compelled to share this experience to caution fellow passengers about the potential misuse of authority by Delta staff. While I have cherished previous experiences with Delta, this incident has left me contemplating a shift to another airline. I believe passengers should not face removal over trivial matters, and I hope Delta takes steps to address such concerns for the well-being of its customers.

While the seats on the flight to Atlanta were fine, the seats on the 15.5 hour A350 flight to Seoul were the most uncomfortable we have ever experienced. It actually hurt to sit down for about 5 days afterwards. The return flight from Seoul to Washington-Dulles on Korean in economy was very comfortable by contrast. Even though the service levels on both airlines were very professional and the food service was very good, we won't fly Delta internationally again. I don't know what they think they are doing, but I won't go near them again for anything beyond short domestic flights.

I have two amazing stories to mention about Delta Airlines:  WOW!!!! I am not going to be able to say enough about this flight attendant. I try to give positive feedback, when possible, but I would have to write a book about FA Stephanie Hedeen Employee Number 856371. I was so rushed this morning and had no sleep from yesterday and I was really dreading this flight this morning. The K-9 dogs in the RDU airport were unsettling and I am not ever a worrier when it comes to flying but the 3 sets that came through in an hour did not help. I boarded the plane and sat down. That was when I met Stephanie. She put me at ease and was just the brightest spot in my day. I was talking to her about why I was traveling today and the next thing I knew she had come back with wings and treats for my grandkids who would be flying for the first time the next morning. She gave me some great advice about Disney and Orlando and some really cool things to do on our family vacation. I was just so honored to have met someone who should be the face of Delta Airlines and definitely a trainer on how to treat customers. I could go on and on about how she went above and beyond for me and all the guests in first class. SHE IS AN ANGEL IN THE SKY!!! I would fly with her all the time.
The second one is:  Little did I know that I would be reviewing what I call the “All Male Crew Review,” but it is just something that I need to share with you. This was my second flight today and I cannot tell you how outstanding your flight attendants have been but there is one in particular that just stood out above all the rest. FA Russell Hoff employee number 946500 is the quintessential representation of what every flight attendant should be on any and all flights. He is charming and very engaging. He has a personality that makes your brand stand out so far above the rest of the other airlines. He went above and beyond not only for me but everyone, and I cannot thank him enough for his generosity, caring and AMAZING customer service. He should be in your training department working with the regional FA’s who could care less about customer service. This man is a “STAR IN THE SKIES,” and I would fly with him anywhere. I hope that you recognize him for his amazing service and his go above and beyond for the customer. Additionally, I had the opportunity to speak with all of the crew and they all had great personalities and customer service as well.

If you are going to travel even though Delta tickets are higher you get what you pay for.  We flew American the next day and it was the worst experience I have ever had in 50 years of flying.

"Desktop","4","review","0",,"I first want to start by saying that though my review is mostly positive, I want to begin by highlighting the most glaringly bad aspect of our recent flights; The very short time between flights. In the first part of our trip to Chicago from Bogota (Atlanta to Chicago leg of the journey), we missed our connecting flight by about 45 minutes and as a result, we needed to reschedule the flight for the following morning. Delta apologized, and gave us a hotel for the night at the Hotel Sonesta and meal vouchers for both my Wife and I. Hotel Sonesta, by the way, is wonderful and We recommend it highly for customer service, equally for Delta. On the second part of our trip (returning to Bogota), We landed at 8:30 am in Atlanta and our connecting flight home to Bogota, Colombia began boarding at 8:50 am. Takeoff was scheduled for 9:45 am. By the time, everyone gets off the plane (which takes about 35 minutes) you have to get to security and pass through, which takes an additional 35 minutes or more, you have nearly no time to use the bathroom and get something to eat. We made our flight thankfully, but this was the second time on the trip where we experienced a super tight schedule. Now, the positive side of Delta and ATL airport. Delta employs some of the nicest, hardest-working people. The level of dedication, the comfort on the planes, and cleanliness is some of the best and at prices that are not unrealistic.  I would recommend that Delta buy more planes, hire more staff, and make the time waiting for a connecting flight at least 2 hours in case there are any holdups due to baggage transfer, deboarding the plane, etc. And finally, as far as the people at ATL Jackson are typical of Georgia, they are some of the finest people in the world. They are very pleasant, helpful, respectful, and dedicated. I would recommend that Delta buy more planes, hire more staff, and make the time waiting for a connecting flight at least 2 hours in case there are any holdups due to baggage transfer, deboarding the plane, etc. Would we fly Delta again?

However, either the flight pattern is too new or Delta is just super disorganized. We had terrible experiences both on our way there and back. On the way from Boston to Mumbai, our Boston Paris leg  was delayed and ultimately cancelled. This had become way too common an occurrence among American carriers on international flights. The reason was a “part” that wasn’t available and had to come from Atlanta. Having flown Air France/Delta before,  this has been a common excuse for delays and ultimate cancellations. The delay meant we’d miss our connection so the only option was switching to Air India which was just terrible (not Delta’s fault)  On the way back, things were on time but the food was terrible on the Mumbai -Paris leg and my husband’s bags didn’t come to Boston.

This winter I flew American Airlines for the first time and regret not flying them all these years. Pre Covid I was given a warm salmon platter and hot towel on my flights. There were many times I flew and there were fresh meals. After Covid I was given a ham sandwich that was putrid along with a quarter sized cookie. Other options were uncooked meals and can show that they have regressed in terms of effort and service.

Now I am an American, but most of the folks on the plane were Asian, including my wife and daughter…… “These people”? Really?

Mid flight, the entire cabin was treated to an angry, threatening, unprofessional tirade over the intercom. We were all scolded because apparently someone decided to smoke in the lavatory…
Yeah, I get it and it happens everywhere, but on every other airline, incidents like these are handled in a professional manner.:“Ladies and Gentlemen, please be reminded that smoking is not permitted on the aircraft and is a violation of law”, or something like that. 

The last straw for me came when they were serving the meals. When I was offered mine, I didn’t hear the choices, so I very politely said “ I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you. What are my choices again?”
The flight attendant let out a very loud sigh, rolled her eyes, then said loudly and flippantly “CHICKEN, FISH, or PASTA”. Feeling embarrassed and berated, I very calmly said “Chicken, please”, but inside I was fuming.

After she handed me my meal and walked away, a gentleman who heard the exchange (across the aisle), touched my arm and said “ She was very rude.”

A few days latter, after getting settled in our new place, I sent Delta an email, expecting nothing more than a sincere apology…. I never received any reply whatsoever.

I have noticed issues on both United and Delta the few times I had taken them before, but this is the second time that Delta unprofessionalism affected me in a direct way, needless to say, I'm done with this airline.","Never Again","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"My wife and I were traveling to New Jersey in 2020 when our accommodations were cancelled due to COVID during the early days of the epidemic.  Delta said we could cancel and use e-ticket credits for the full amount of our fares at a later date.  Our Delta Skymiles accounts both showed the correct amount of our e-credits, and the date by which we needed to redeem, so we took them at their word.  When we went to redeem the credit with Delta by phone, the agent said we had $100 less than what we had showing in our Skymiles accounts, and gave a bogus reason.  When questioned, she backpedaled to saying we had $50 less in our accounts rather than $100 less, and said that the $50 was being deduced because we had booked our original flights through Expedia, and there was a $50 rebooking fee, even though we had - in writing - communication from Delta saying that no re-booking fees would be charged (waived due to COVID disruption policies), and had been assured this policy would apply to our 3rd party tickets.  We explained to the Delta agent and then to a Supervisor Felicia that we were currently looking online at Skyscanner, and could book there (using our full Delta E-credit amounts) tickets that were $40 less that the credit we were each due, yet we called to book directly with Delta so we could book both tickets together - rather than individual purchases with Skyscanner.  The Supervisor Felicia in Atlanta would not allow us to book the same flight without paying SUBSTANTIALLY more than we could book through Skyscanner online, using our full E-credit amounts due.  We hung up the phone and booked those flights through Skyscanner with more Delta E-credit than what Delta would allow working directly them.  This was ridiculous.  We had no trouble booking with Skyscanner.  Our original concern, that my wife might book her ticket and I might not get the same flight booking immediately after her, did not materialize.  

My point is this: Skyscanner gave us the credit we were due when Delta would not, even though Delta had promised to do so.  No more flights with Delta for us.  With the online Skyscanner site we see that - across the board- Delta tickets are so much more expensive than what other airlines charge.  Why pay more for bad customer service?  Nope.","Delta didn’t honor their COVID re-booking promise.","false","false"

You win. You have beaten me down and conquered me and I lay down my sword in utter defeat. You will spend not another moment of your valuable time or another dime in paying your customer “service” representatives to hear my piteous complaint. You have lost a 35 YEAR customer and clearly couldn’t care less.

Through a mix-up no fault of my own my daughter received my Skymiles this last year. When I discovered this I contacted Delta to correct the situation. They told me I needed to contact AMEX to rectify the situation. Reasonable enough. AMEX  said only Delta could transfer the miles and to call them again. That made sense. Delta said it really was AMEX’s situation to deal with and to call back and request an “escalation” through some type of special branch of customer service. OooooKkkkk…NOPE!! “Only Delta can fix this, Mr. Wolf.” I have made THIRTEEN phone calls back-and-forth between the two companies and after this morning’s call I give up. I GIVE UP. I’ve spent valuable hours and hours in this unbelievably frustrating process trying to complete what should be a few simple keystrokes by SOMEBODY to no avail. I’ve been nice and I’ve been mean. I’ve been quiet and calm and I’ve been loud and angry. ￼I’ve spoken to 20 different customer service representatives and supervisors. I’ve been transferred and escalated and called back and been left PANTING in anger and disbelief.

In 25 years of owning a successful business I have satisfied EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER—EVERY…SINGLE…ONE. I have bent over backwards and done what it’s taken to make sure in the end my clients experiences have been good and positive and they got exactly what they wanted.￼ Delta Airlines and American Express have millions of customers and clearly couldn’t give a darn if nasty Mr. Wolf stops doing business with them and goes elsewhere. Customer service and customer satisfaction is a thing of the past in this country and I wish my next trip instead of being on a cramped  Delta Airlines jet plane was in a TIME MACHINE and I could go back to a time when all companies were like mine and bent over backwards to take care of the ￼people that insured their financial survival but there’s no such thing so I’ll just live in this  time and grumble and mumble and be that foul old man that people give a wide berth on the sidewalk as he comes towards them, head bent in disgust and defeat talking about the “good old days.”

Lots of passengers discussing the fact that no-one smiled, all made you feel like we were all an inconvenience!  If anyone asked for a drink they made you feel like it was so much trouble, that's if they could be bothered to answer at all.
They looked dishevelled and their uniforms could barely pass as such!  Most flight attendants look immaculate, to the point of glamourous/smart, on this flight yhey looked like they had overslept and grabbed what they could to wear!
2 of the 4 of us received headphones, when an hour later the other two asked if they could have their headphones they were abruptly informed that they'd run out and the American's on board were their priority!! (Are they even allowed to say that?  We paid for  our flight just like the rest of the passengers.  So many unhappy people.  Surely when you pay for a flight, part of that would be for entertainment, especially on long haul flights!  The food was dreadful (but I can cope with that).  However, we also had to ask for them to take our litter, as well as other passengers, it's just unacceptable.
It became almost amusing to watch them.  Such an unhappy bunch of people.  
Our flight was somewhat better on return to LHR Tuesday night and the attendants were definitely a lot smarter and a little more pleasant. In saying that, most of the passengers including myself slept for the majority of the flight, so they did not have to engage with us much.
Despite the seats being comfortable, I really don't have anything else positive to say.
I would never recommend Delta, in fact I would go as far as to advise my friends and family to avoid using the airline at all costs.

Today I head to the airport ready to get home, when we’re met with yet another road block. This time we get to the airport here in Peru and our tickets don’t even exist. After talking to multiple employees they all say the same thing (your tickets don’t exist in our system).

I will now be in Peru for god knows how long, resulting in possibly loosing my job back at home.

Our return flight was abruptly cancelled while waiting in the check-in line and rescheduled without proper notice, attributed to 'IT technical issues'. When we sought recourse through an APPR complaint, we were met with a shocking denial and a claim that the flight wasn't delayed—an alarming display of disorganization and misinformation. To add insult to injury, we received damaged luggage, and our subsequent complaint has been pending with no resolution from Lynx Air. This experience wasn't just poor customer service; it was a complete failure of their system.

Once I chose my flights, times and layovers etc that would work, I attempted to purchase the tickets. Multiple attempts wouldn't work. It gave a number to call for help. The gentleman I spoke to from that number told me the site was down and he could book the flights for me from his end. His price was higher. I wanted the price I had available to me online and didn't feel I should have to pay more b/c their site was down. 30 min and three 10 min holds and multiple excuses later I was told I had to take the higher price. Two of the holds were for him to talk to his supervisor. After a 10 min hold he finally agreed to put his supervisor on for me to talk to. I explained the situation and that I wanted the price I had tried to book.  She insisted I send her photos of the summary of costs which I did. She tried to get me to open a tab that wouldn't work. She asked at least 5 times with me explaining that it didn't open or show anything. She made it clear she thought I was lying. I again took a photo and sent it to her and reminded her that it was their site that was down. She again gave all the excuses of why they couldn't give me the price from their own website that I had just obtained. Now very angry I told her exactly why each of her excuses were bogus and that I expected her to follow through with the price their site was offering. I maintained my cool, was polite but she knew I was angry. She left me on hold for another 35 min!!!!!!!  I was pretty sure she did it on purpose.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"Think Delta treats all its passengers equally? Think again. My recent experience shattered this illusion, revealing a stark reality: if you're not in first class, you're invisible to Delta. 

The ordeal began innocuously enough – I simply requested a glass of wine during the in-flight service, akin to what I would on any other airline. To my astonishment, I was flatly denied, with the crew member condescendingly explaining that wine was a privilege reserved for first-class passengers only. This bewildering policy was apparently due to the 'short-haul flight' rule, yet inexplicably, those at the front of the plane enjoyed their drinks undisturbed. 

This blatant disparity sparked a heated debate, during which I felt an unprecedented level of disrespect as a paying customer. Every other airline I've flown with has offered this basic courtesy, often complimentary. Delta, however, has shown a clear bias, prioritizing first-class passengers and treating the rest as second-class citizens.

I am profoundly disappointed and disheartened by Delta's discriminatory approach and utter disregard for passenger satisfaction. Their staff's dismissive attitude left me feeling belittled and mistreated.

This flight was a red eye scheduled to leave PHX at 12:01am on a newly built Airbus A350-900. I had originally booked this flight in economy to sit in the first window seat on the left side after the L3 door (door right behind the wing). This aircraft, with producing 164,000 pounds of thrust with its Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, can travel on flights longer than 14 hours and  can hold up to 306 passengers with thousands of pounds of cargo. Although on this night, it was only filled with 12 passengers, approximately 4 hours of fuel, and around 50-70 pounds of cargo (according to the pilots). 
   First off, while walking into the checkin area for delta at PHX Sky Harbor, the checkin wasn’t that busy at all. The very wonderful agent at the Sky Priority (SP)   checkin decided to call me over and help me check in without caring wether or not to see if I was apart of SP or not, which was super nice of him. Next, I talked to one of the pilots of whom was flying us up to MSP and explained to him how excited I am to be on a almost completely empty A350. Of which then he said it’s a lot of power for such a light load so he will set to minimum Take off thrust on the takeoff roll. Later on, as I boarded the plane, I asked the lead flight attendant if it’ll be okay to sit in one of the Delta One suites just for a few seconds and then I’ll head over to my assigned economy seat but she looked at the cabin and just said “there’s only 4 people in first class, just sit there for the whole flight!” After this I was extremely happy I was definitely smiling and giggling the whole flight. But before push back, the pilot I talked to earlier came up to me and said he has a surprise for me. Which to find out, on takeoff roll, both pilots put in MAX takeoff thrust and we shot out of that place like a rocket and it was so amazing. Next, while in the middle of the flight, I decided to walk around and make small talk to every flight attendant and every one of them was just so nice and definitely seemed happy to all be there. I even found another av-geek/flight attendant that understood and shared the same passion as I have for aircraft such as the one we were flying on.

When we were searching tickets online, apart from Southwest, Delta was the second most cheapest and I wasn’t sure what to expect. It was so very much better than the AA flights we had taken earlier and much much cheaper. I would be super happy to fly Delta again but would cringe at having to fly AA again. I can’t believe AA don’t have tvs and you have to byo device. They can justify it how they want with free wifi but it’s a disgrace for families who can’t bring 5 devices with them when travelling overseas. Thank you Delta we had a great experience with you.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I will be try to be brief with my comments regarding the very poor service of accountability the Delta Airlines Baggage service staff has to its customers. 
To begin on 11/1/2023 I missed my flight to Austin TX from Detroit Metro due to excessive TSA checkin lines but that’s another review needless to say this was one of the worse days of my life. 
Now back to why I’m writing this post, so I miss my plane but Delta has loaded my suitcase and flew it to Austin’s airport. Keep in mind when I missed my flight I immediately contacted Delta and they assured me my bag would be held safely at the baggage claim office in Austin until I arrived just show my ID and my baggage ticket to the agent in the office and you can pick up your bag. I called Delta customer and baggage service departments more than once on 11/1/2023 to reconfirm my bag would be safe and ready for me to pickup when I arrived on the next mornings flight DL 1598. I arrived on 11/2/2023 and to my surprise at 11:23am I approach the Austin baggage claim office with 1 agent and a police officer inquiring about my bag. The Delta agent immediately states your bag should be in the line of bags just outside this office (no ID check, no name check, no bag ticket check). I go look in this line of bags and my bag is not there. So I go back to the office with the agent and now she takes my name and ticket bag and restates your bag should be there, so myself, the agent another agent and my car service driver go look at the line of bags again my bag isn’t there.  So now the agent nonchalantly tells me “ your bag was probably stolen and I can’t watch the bags all of the time when I’m here in the office alone. But I wasn’t on last nights shift. All I can do for you is submit a mishandled claim and after 5 days if you don’t receive your bag you can put in a claim for your lost bag. Then the police offer says “you can file a police report too so a detective can be assigned to the case and review video”

I’m going to end here because it is now 11/4/2023 and I’m still here in Austin without my luggage and the various items I brought for my business trip. I finally went to the shopping stores yesterday to purchase items to have a change of clothes etc.. 
I filed a theft report online with the Austin police this morning, so I’m in this loop of consistent waiting with Delta Airlines and now the Austin Texas police.

I’ll be flying back to DTW early tomorrow morning but this experience has been very poorly handled by the Delta baggage claim staff and Delta management in my opinion. The changes I’m going thru with the various processes has been very stressful and I’m disappointed in Delta Airlines.

Delta Airline baggage operations you have an unsafe process and your agents have bad attitudes. No one in the airport should be able to walk up to bags under your surveillance and just pick one and walk away without interacting with one of your agents verifying, and assisting a customer who is picking up a bag. So your agent’s comment to me was disgraceful and disrespectful. She has a job to do and watching and protecting customers bags is her responsibility. 
Put the bags back into the closed office back room not out in the open on the airport floor unsecured where thousands of people go in and out of the airport daily or have your agent’s stand/sit next to the bags you pile in an unsecured line versus sitting and talking with colleagues inside a office with a glass window to view the unsecured line of bags that are susceptible to theft!","Delta Airlines Lost My Luggage","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Our Flight out was uneventful and fine.  Business class was OK, not the best but not the worst, but the service was great.
Everything went downhill on the way back when we had the absolute worst experience and terrible after service.

We had connecting flights from Honolulu to London via Minneapolis.  Our first leg home from Honolulu to Minneapolis was brought forward making our layover much longer and we were in the airport for 11 hours just on the layover.  Our second flight was booked for 17.15

At 5pm, there was a change on the board from 17.15 to 19.30 - no explanation.  We were in the lounge so we were OK really. Outside, the passengers were receiving meal vouchers.  We were entitled to these, however, they were absolutely useless - each passenger entitled to just $15 each - and you couldn't use these as part payment!!!  I heard that most passengers were adding these onto their amazon account but they were american passengers - it didn't seem to work for UK accounts.  As most meals were over $15 it was a very unfriendly system.

At 17.30 the notice changed from 19.30 to 21.30, again no explanation was given, at this point we had to start asking.  It turned out that a part was faulty on the plane that was needed for when it landed in Heathrow in order to engage with the disembarking tunnel.  But their engineers were trying to get one off of a grounded airplane and fit it to ours - there were hopeful that we would be flying at 21.30.   

However, the lounge was closing at 10pm and we had to be out.  They were going to keep the OTHER lounge open JUST for these passengers of the delayed flight and the OTHER lounge was a 15 minute walk away!!!!  The lounge we were in was right next to the gate!!!!  How ridiculous and deliberate to put the passengers OFF of going to the other lounge.  

At 21.30 there was no sign of us getting on the plane and the staff on the gate were clueless - then about 22.00 it changed to flying at 23.30.  With some strong indicators that it would defintely be happening.  At 23.30 the pilot and hostesses were seen on the plane and it definitely looked like they were getting ready to load, and an announcement was made that they were getting ready to load - the plane had been fixed.  Great.

But after what looked like much confusion and calls to the staff at the gate, nearly midnight - almost 7 hours after were were supposed to fly.  They announced that unfortunately, due to the fact that the flight staff would end up over their hours if they took the flight, they couldn't' do it and the flight was just cancelled.  Not postponed, not rebooked for the following morning - just cancelled.  

We were hoarded like cattle over to another desk where we had to line up AN ENTIRE PLANE OF PASSENGERS being seen by just one clerk to rearrange their flights!!!  We were told more staff would be coming to help but after half an hour the murmurs came down the line that no-one else was coming and the girl that was there was leaving in 10 minutes.  Less than a 10th of the flight had been seen!!!  

We were given cards with advise and who to call.  So, almost 1am in the morning, almost 8 hours after we were due to fly and 19 hours since we landed, we had to find a hotel and book a taxi.  And rebook our flights home.  

I called the number on the advise and they rebooked us, but we had to wait 2 days to get business class or fly economy the following day.  Due to work commitments I had no choice and we had to fly economy the next day.  

The hotel booking was easy, however, the taxi was not.  The taxi system they use was terrible, we had to have a US number (so we had to ask for help and have a friend let us use their number), but the drivers kept bumping us as they didn't want a fare through delta.  It took 40 minutes to get the taxi!!!  And taxi that did come for us had an illegal windscreen - it was smashed in no less than 4 places (as if with a baseball bat) and shattered.

The following morning was worse.  We were bumped 3 times, so eventually I had to use my Uber account and pay for our own taxi.  Something they won't reimburse us!!!!

We were by then seriously concerned we would miss our flight!!  

After such a serious delay AND being put down to economy, I have had to fight, and still am, for any kind of refund and it is still ongoing with no end in sight.  

I asked for a FULL refund of all return flights as our entire journey home was completely ruined, compensation for the delay and the taxi fare.

I do not think that is unreasonable given the utter farce we were faced with.  And most importantly that the fact the flight was cancelled was down to a something that they should have been aware of much earlier on in the process, yet they pulled it out the bag at the last minute when everyone was too tired and had had enough.  The miscommunication, disorganisation and utter ineptitude was diabolical - added to by a down right disgraceful response to my claim - something I am being discriminated for as a UK citizen - apparently the US passengers got a far more realistic claim as they are based in the US.  

This was almost 3 months ago and despite starting the claims process the day after getting home, it's still ongoing.  Another feather of ineptitude in your cap DELTA!!!

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"Subject: Disheartening Experience on Delta Flight 800

Dear Delta Customer Service,

I am writing to express my profound disappointment with the service I received on Delta Flight 800. I have always chosen Delta for its reputation for superior service and reliability, but my recent experience has made me reconsider that choice.

To begin with, I was taken aback when, after upgrading to Comfort Class, I was relocated from an aisle seat to a middle seat without any prior notification or choice. Such a switch considerably reduced the comfort level I had anticipated with the upgrade. This was the first sign of my forthcoming ordeal.

Upon addressing my concern at the airport, I was given a sheer run-around, being referred from one agent to another, with each passing the responsibility onto someone else. It felt as though my comfort and satisfaction as a customer were not valued in the slightest.

My in-flight experience was no better. The flight attendants seemed disinterested and distant, making me feel more like a burden than a valued passenger. My simple request for an apple juice was met with confusion as I was handed a diet coke instead. This may seem like a trivial mistake, but it's indicative of the lack of attention to passenger needs.

Moreover, after requesting headsets to perhaps distract myself from the accumulating frustrations, I had to repeat my request. Waiting an hour for such a basic amenity is unacceptable, especially when I could see other passengers receiving prompt service.

I had hoped that my upgrade to Comfort Class would ensure a pleasant journey, but I found myself facing a series of disappointments and inconveniences. The lack of coordination, attention to detail, and basic courtesy have left a lasting negative impression.

I urge Delta to look into these matters seriously. No passenger should feel as undervalued and disregarded as I did on Flight 800. I hope for a prompt response addressing my concerns and detailing the actions Delta intends to take to rectify these glaring service issues.","Disheartening Experience on Delta Flight 800","false","false"

On my way down the previous Saturday, we had a layover in SLC from GEG and took them to the Delta Lounge. I have a Reserve card and was going to use one of my passes for my wife and my daughter I assumed would just come along. After showing my boarding pass the attendant then typed some things to allow my wife in with one of my passes and we enjoyed some time in the lounge before flying out. On the way back yesterday we again stopped in at the lounge between flights. I scanned my boarding pass and the attendant then came over and I said I had another pass for my wife. They said all passes had been used a few days earlier. I said that must be a mistake because I had two and only used one for my wife. They told me both had been used, for my wife and child. The attendant then told me the charge for both of them to enter the lounge would then be $100. I understood the $50 for my wife but I was very taken aback that I was being charged $50 for my 8-year-old daughter who was only going to have a cookie or two! $50 for an adult I completely understand with liquor and food, but a child cannot possibly warrant a $50 charge. I paid the fee because we were already there and my daughter was looking forward to going back and having a cookie, but I felt, and have continued to feel, taken advantage of and this experience has left a very uncomfortable feeling with me. I don't know if I will continue my business with Delta because of this. It was a very unfortunate ending to a great vacation.

I can safely say that I will, in future will not travel on what once was considered an excellent, American commercial airline.

My husband and I booked a round-trip flight from JAX to ATL to DUB back in March 2023. We were supposed to depart JAX on May 24, 2023, make our connection in Atlanta then fly to Dublin for a May 25 morning arrival. Our flight on May 24 was delayed due to a flat tire; mind you, we heard the ground crew tell the Delta representative at the flight gate that they use the last tire three days prior. With the amount of air traffic between JAX and Atlanta, which is a Delta hub, you would think they would have transported tires/had enough inventory for these types of incidents. That aside, our flight was delayed until the following day. To spare you, the reader, a missive worthy of St. Paul, we were delayed two more times and did not arrive in Dublin until Saturday evening, May 27. We had to fly into Paris before making it to Dublin. During the transfer, our suitcase was left in Paris for 10 days. oh, I should also mention that we brought our three children, all under the age of 10, with us on this trip. I am so proud of how they behaved, but traveling with small children for such an experience is very challenging as I’m sure any parent could tell you.

My husband spent half a day (May 29) at Dublin airport, trying to arrange for our bag to arrive; fortunately, we had an apple AirTag tucked into it, which, if you do carry a bag anywhere, I highly recommend the AirTag. He also scheduled our return flight for a later date so we can make up for the lost time.

When we returned home, we submitted or grievances to Delta very politely, with all receipts attached, etc. Delta responded by offering us each a $100 travel voucher and approximately $300  in compensation for the hotel we had to stay in while waiting for our flight in Atlanta. We do not travel very often which made the vouchers useless to us, thus, we found this resolution unsatisfactory. We wished for (minimum) compensation for the two nights’ accommodations we lost in Dublin in addition to for the hotel we had to arrange in order to maximize our visit (~$2000). I should also mention we had to purchase a couple items of clothing as we were without a suitcase for 10 days.

Delta, in their arrogance, sent us a reply email telling us they were closing our case - here is a sampling of what they said:

“This is a copy of the final email that was sent on August 14th, 2023. We do appreciate your persistence but we will have to agree that we cannot find the right solution this time. Any further communication after this email would not be productive and we will not respond again regarding this incident.”

This was so weak and ridiculous considering we were happy to negotiate and come to some agreement that would have been more than reasonable for Delta to honor.

Delta’s revenue increased approximately 20% this past year and their operating margin rose from 9% to 11%. I understand that the commercial airline industry suffered during the pandemic, but they received recourse from the American taxpayer, of which I am one of them. My family did not qualify for such recourse.

Delta could do better… $300 in hotel compensation and $500 worth of travel vouchers (which will never be used) is insulting, and shows very little regard for the consumer considering we experienced three total delays in our outbound flight. These delays were not caused by any FAA issues; they were all caused by internal issues Delta had.  For future European travel, I will opt to drive to Orlando or Tampa, and fly direct via an EU-based airline. I will not fly Delta internationally ever again; and I certainly will avoid using them for domestic travel.","Delta refuses appropriate compensation for three days travel delay","false","false"
"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I'm retired so I don't travel for business anymore, therefore, I no longer have a medallion status nor sky priority. I do fly Delta Comfort +. Not first class but certainly not the cheapest seats on the plane. I booked my flight a few months in advance and reserved a seat on the isle as I always do. When I boarded the plane in Amsterdam, on my way back to NY, I realized that I was not assigned the seat I reserved! I was sandwiched in the middle of the middle row, still in comfort +; I would never have paid for this seat. I'm not the type to start arguing with the airline attendants so I just took the seat. The seat I reserved was not far from me and I observed that a Dutch speaking woman was in my seat. When I got home, I complained to Delta and was told they have the right to do this to ""improve operations"". I spoke to a few friends of mine who said they had a similar experience. Delta allows their partner airlines to move seats booked by Americans to accommodate people that are citizens of their country. Delta did offer me a few sky miles to compensate, but I can no longer trust them to give me the seat I paid for and reserved. My days of flying comfort + are over, it's just not worth it. I checked a bag at JFK on my way out and the process was pure chaos. During my flight to Europe, I asked the airline attendant for some snacks and was told to go back to the galley and get them. I don't mind spending the few extra dollars if I get what I pay for, but it just was not worth it. I'm using Delta again next week to fly out to Arizona, I booked a main cabin seat this time. I've been flying Delta exclusively for about 12 years now. Next flight, I'm going to check out American airlines. ","Americans Beware ","false","false"

But returning Delta One....horrendous,  the ladies at the gate wouldn't let me board with my duty free shopping. I asked twice what should I do? They kept saying no federal law only 2 personal items and i had a case a laptop bag and one small bag of duty free shopping.

I was meant to be boarding swiftly as a delta one passenger........I was so stressed  after trying unsuccessfully pushing into ny case i said  again what do you expect me to do.

I eventually got hold of a older lady clearly the supervisor and she said let me look at your shopping, she looked and said you are ok to board!!

So after an embarrassing stressful time at the gate I was then allowed to board with exactly what I had after all a case, laptop bag n small bag of duty free shopping!!

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"I flew to New York on September 7th with Virgin, landed at JFK mid-afternoon and rechecked my bags for my Delta Connect (A Virgin partner) flight to Toronto. My flight was showing a 2 hour delay till 22.30pm.
Closer to departure the flight was cancelled apparently due to bad weather. I did note that other Airline flights were departing to the same destination and in the same region. 
I went to the information desk and was told that I had been rebooked onto the same flight 24 hours later September 8th. I asked if there were earlier flights next day; but was told that all were fully booked. The next day I decided to go to the Terminal early; to ensure that I was booked on the flight. At check in I was told there was a flight leaving at 2.00pm; I opted for that to make up time. After boarding and taxiing the plane stood for a long while. A thunderstorm then began over JFK and we returned to the gate. At the gate it was announced the flight was cancelled (This was not Deltas fault). So back to the information desk; where I was told there were no more flights today (Friday) and no seats on Saturday flights either. I stressed that I had to get to Toronto by Saturday Evening as I had onward travel booked. Eventually It was suggested that I took a flight to Minneapolis & St Paul and then a connection to Toronto. However, this flight was on Saturday morning at 11.00am from La Guardia. I opted to take it as I saw myself living in JFK for my holiday. So phoned the Agent in UK to update and arrange cover for another hotel room. Now I had to collect my luggage and proceed to La Guardia. I could not find my luggage at the carousel. Proceeded to Baggage claim which appeared to be overwhelmed and in chaos. My bag was showing as being in the airport. A search was instigated. This was 6.00pm on Friday evening. After several reminders eventually at 2.00am on Saturday morning my bag was found (thanks to a very helpful baggage handler who I got talking to). Now to get a cab to LaGuardia; no chance of a hotel bed for the night! You will be pleased to know that I arrived at my hotel in Toronto at 8.30pm on Saturday 9th September. I never saw Toronto as I had to depart next morning for Niagara.
As my flights with Virgin/Delta were booked using one flight code, I was not able to book an alternative flight for this leg(these were available) with another airline from JFK to Toronto without my next two flights being cancelled. If you look at a map Minneapolis & St Paul is over a 1000 miles west of NY and then you are flying back east to Toronto; an arrow flight path.
Delta totally spoilt my holiday as I was tired from lack of sleep and distress for the first few days. I really do not think they care about their passengers at all and obviously they will not compensate you for inconvenience.

However, after midnight, I haven’t heard from Delta or Alaska Airlines regarding my lost baggage. I called Delta baggage at 3 a.m., and she told me my bag arrived at midnight via Alaska Airlines. So this morning, at 7:30 a.m., I went to the airport to pick up my bag. And I was told by the Delta agent that my bag was not in yet and would be available at 8 p.m. tonight. So I went to Delta Airlines again, and they were already closed at 8 p.m. I asked Alaska Airlines if my baggage had arrived, and they said they didn’t know anything about it, especially since I didn’t fly through Alaska Airlines. I have my laptop, my notes, and my iPad; in short, I have everything important in my carry-on. I have an exam tomorrow and don’t have any means of getting my computer for an exam tomorrow morning.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"In January 2023, I undertook a series of flights with Delta Airlines partner airlines, specifically Latam Airlines (LA 3760 on January 8, 2023, and LA 292 on January 19, 2023) and Aerolineas Argentinas (AR 1751 on January 11, 2023, and AR 1926 on January 12, 2023). These flights were eligible for mileage credit through Delta's frequent flyer program.

Upon my return to the United States following these flights, I promptly submitted requests for mileage credit through Delta's website as per their prescribed procedure. However, despite complying with the required waiting period of 14 days for mileage credit to post, none of the flights received the expected mileage credit. Furthermore, I did not receive any confirmation email for my initial requests, exacerbating the issue.

In response to this situation, I resubmitted my mileage credit requests via the website and initiated a formal case (Case No. 44105918) on January 27, 2023. However, once again after waiting the requisite 14 days for credit to post, no mileage credit was ever posted for these flights.

Subsequently, on March 21, 2023, I reached out to Delta's customer service by phone, enduring an arduous wait time exceeding one hour before connecting with a representative. This agent manually entered my credit requests and reassured me that my requests were logged well within the 9-month timeframe. The agent emphasized that, although it might take some time for my credits to post, I had fulfilled all requirements on my part, and there was no need for further follow-up.

However, by the summer of 2023, only mileage credit for AR 1926 had been posted, while the other three flights remained uncredited. Despite my persistent efforts to follow up with Delta on multiple occasions, I was discouraged by the extensive wait times and ultimately gave up in frustration.

Desiring a final resolution, I contacted Delta once again on October 16, 2023. To my astonishment, the agent claimed that they had absolutely no record of my earlier requests. Nevertheless, the agent acknowledged that, despite more than 9 months having passed for two of my flights, they could still request mileage credit on my behalf, as my initial requests were made within the 9-month period. The agent then manually entered my flight details.

The agent was able to successfully obtain credit for AR1751, which posted the next day. However, she advised that there was an alleged lack of necessary documentation for the LATAM flights. In response, I promptly explained that the combination of the itinerary, receipt, and boarding passes provided contained all required information to complete my request. I later obtained letters from LATAM confirming all the required details and submitted the same to the agent. The agent, however, has neither acknowledged receipt of the documents nor provided any further information regarding my case. Indeed, it appears that they have stopped working on it completely.   

I contacted Delta once more on October 17, 2023, seeking confirmation that they had all the information they needed to request credit and was abruptly told that I “could not keep calling them” claiming that doing so may delay the process. This is despite the fact that this was only my second call of the week (and comes after multiple failed attempts to get Delta to grant mileage credit over the course of the year). Furthermore, the agent informed me that no confirmation number or case number would be provided for my call.

It is my strong belief that this prolonged run-around, the failure to provide confirmation e-mails and numbers, the gaslighting by customer service (claiming wrongly that they were being delayed because I was somehow calling them too much), the excuses that they need more information to be provided to complete my requests, the arduous customer service wait times, and Delta’s losing any record of my previous mileage credit requests represents ""intentional friction"" orchestrated by Delta Airlines to frustrate customers in their efforts to claim mileage credit. This is a frustrating situation, as I have made diligent efforts to adhere to Delta's requirements and timelines, only to be met with inconsistency, contradictory information, and ultimately the denial of deserved mileage credit.

They tried to set us in different rows (its our anniversary).  I had to beg the lady at the gate to get us seated back together.  (How humiliating). The meals were very bad and that was just the flight going.  The flight back was just as bad.  Now Delta Sent out a WE APOLOGIZE email to all members because they tried to screw all SKYMILES MEMBERS.  And their apology is really for the BIG MONEY GUYS and CORPORATIONS.  Delta does not give CRAP about Loyalty.  31 YEARS I have been a SkyMiles member.   Delta ONLY count LONG-TERM Loyalty for people with HIGH MILES (1Million or more).  What about people like me who have been LOYAL to ONLY Fly Delta. Not for a FEW years but for DECADES, since back in the 90s.  I guess I am not LOYAL because I do not have 1M Miles, just a few hundred thousand.

Everything that could go wrong with the travel accommodations seemed to manifest. However the lack of communication, due diligence and interest in assistance from staff was astoundingly disappointing. After having my flight (DL5697) delayed and my connecting flight (DL62) rebooked prior to landing at JFK I was informed that I wouldn’t be able to leave JFK until 9/24/23 23:45. As I was due to attend my father’s partner’s funeral the next morning this was more than an inconvenience. After explaining my situation to several customer service agents and having an emotional breakdown at the airport I was booked on a flight departing EWR on British Airways departing at 0700 without any of my luggage.  After an $180 taxi and assurance of my bags being placed on the flight out of JFK that evening I arrived in London Heathrow more than 70 miles from my intended destination and 40 miles from my intended airport. Incident claim number LGWDL13314 was assigned to me in an attempt to help track the movement of my luggage that was due to arrive Monday 9/25/23 at noon. By Wednesday 9/27/23 I had been instructed to make two fruitless round trips to retrieve baggage that had not even departed JFK. I then received I call from the Baggage Claims department informing that delivery would be set up for Thursday 9/28/23 and because I would be attending a memorial service a courtesy call would be given to facilitate the delivery. Imagine my surprise finding my belongings left unattended on the entrance of a public apartment building. After more assurances from several customer service agents that all expenses would be reimbursed and at this point a refund for the flights would be forthcoming at the conclusion of this trip I have found even more confusion, lack of accountability and interest in helping resolve this matter. After feeling like I’d failed my father in being there for him during one of the most trying times of his life I find myself reliving the experience every time I call for clarification.

If an adult passenger was being unruly or disruptive, how many times have you seen on the news of Cabin Crew having someone to deplane, yet they do nothing with passengers who do not supervise their children. They are simply allowed to ignore those instances of disruption.

Delta rejected the hotel for not having enough info. We had provided our receipt as well as the booking.com confirmation.  Filed a complaint on the $400 since was clearly Delta's fault.

On 12-24-2022, I embarked on a journey that involved flights from three countries, with Deltabeing my chosen carrier. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by the cancellation of my last destination, which was Seattle to SLC DL2360. My flight conformation #HVHI5D  This incident has left me with several concerns and inconveniences.

Here are some of the key details of my experience:
- Flight details:DL 2360, Seattle and arrival Salt Lakecity, December24th,2022.
- I was scheduled to fly from Seattle to SaltLakecity. Regrettably, my flight was canceled without prior notice, and I was rebooked to arrive at an entirely different destination, Boise Idaho. This sudden change caused a series of inconveniences, which I wish to bring to your attention. 
Additional expenses: Due to the unexpected change, I had to book a hotel in Boise and rent a car to drive to my intended destination, Salt lake city. This resulted in unforeseen costs .Inconveniences and disruptions: The unexpected changes disrupted my travel plans, causing stress and inconvenience.

I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to flight cancellations, but I believe it is essential for airlines to handle such situations with transparency, efficiency, and customer care. My experience has left me with a negative impression of Delta and I hope that by sharing this feedback, the airline can take steps to improve its services and customer support in the future.

I kindly request that you investigate this matter and provide me with a response that addresses my concerns and outlines any steps the airline plans to take to prevent similar incidents in the future. I would also appreciate any compensation or assistance that can help mitigate the inconveniences caused by the cancellation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt response and resolution of these issues.

Sincerely,

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"I am writing this review, as a Platinum Medallion member and longstanding loyal customer of Delta, to let your organization know about an extremely frustrating experience that I have gone through. It has spanned two days and is still not resolved.

This past Monday, I attempted to book a vacation for my family of five and one infant through Delta Vacations (and subsequently, Delta Airlines). The online tool was broken.  It would not allow me to add my address. Therefore, I could not add my credit card info.

I also needed to add an infant in arms and there was no place to add this infant.

I eventually called the help desk at Delta Vacations.  I was helped and the trip was booked. I did ask about adding the infant and was told I could add him later. This was incorrect, he should have added him at the time of booking.

My tickets were ineligible for upgrade. Three of us are platinum medallion members. I asked him about this. He stated that it would take 24 hours to post on the airline’s system and would automatically update. Not true!

Tuesday, I checked my Delta app, and it was still showing upgrade ineligible. I called the airline. I was told that the vacations folks needed to separate the tickets because there were too many people to allow upgrades.

At the same time my daughter called regarding her son, the infant in arms.  Delta airlines added him and charged her approximately $177.00 for taxes.

I then called Delta Vacations to request that the tickets be separated out, and I was told that they were.  I received an email confirming this.  

The itinerary was still showing us as ineligible for upgrade.

My next call was to Delta Airlines, I let them know that the tickets had been separated out. I was told that the confirmation numbers could not be located in Delta Airline’s system. I was told to go back to Delta Vacations and have them correct it. Evidently, the two systems don’t sync. This is crazy to me given it's the same company. Also, customers should be told this at some point.

I called Delta Vacations again, this is now the fifth call of the day. I was told that it was a SkyMiles issue and was transferred to SkyMiles. I was disconnected.
I called back, explained at length what was going on, and asked to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold and then disconnected once again.

It is now 2:30 pm mountain standard time and I have been working on this off and on for six hours, being ping-ponged back and forth between Delta Airlines and Delta Vacations. No one could help, no one knew how to fix the issue and I could not get a supervisor.

At 2:45 I called Delta Vacations. This call lasted an hour and 45 minutes. I spoke with Darcie. She was the first person who listened to me and had a genuine concern. She took my call back number and promised that she would call back if I got disconnected. She reached out to a supervisor, Greer. Between Greer and Darcie, they fixed all issues. The tickets were separated out appropriately. The infant in arms was added correctly.
I was able to confirm everything on my Delta app before the call was over.

All above should have been done on the first call. Not one person within either organization was willing to help me until my eighth call. 

The last thing that needed to be done was to pay taxes for the infant.  I did not know that my daughter had already done this. Because the two systems are different, there was no way to know she had paid.  I was told it would be $67.95. Much less than what my daughter was told to pay. Why such a discrepancy? Why no record of the first payment?

My daughter is now trying to get the charge reversed with Delta Airlines.

When the charge of $67.95 was charged, I instead received a $67,395.00 charge on my American Express. Let me repeat, a $67,395.00 charge. That is an egregious mistake on Delta’s part.

Darcie was very confused as to why this happened. She called the accounting department, and they were closed for the day. Please remember that this call was an hour and 45 minutes. I was told that this would be handled first thing Wednesday morning, today.  

I received a notice from American Express that I will not have access to my card until this is cleared up. This means that for a minimum of three days I will not be able to use my card. My son and husband are on this account too. No one can use their cards.

Not only has this fiasco been extremely difficult, but I am also in a situation where no one in my family can use their American Express cards, which is our only credit card and used every day for purchases.

American Express is aware and won’t be able to do anything until Delta Vacations makes the correction.

I have been a dedicated Delta customer for many years, as you can see on my account. I fly exclusively Delta when I have the option. I am a Platinum Medallion member with you. I could have booked my vacation with Costco, Expedia or any other agency but I choose Delta because I am a loyal customer. This whole fiasco is making me greatly regret my decision to trust Delta with my vacation, as we have already had a myriad of issues occur and the trip hasn’t even happened yet.

My hope is that someone who has some authority will look at all that has taken place and make some much needed adjustments to policies and procedures, not to mention training for the employees.

Currently the travel issues have all been corrected. The charges for the infant in arms have FINALLY been corrected (after another 2 hours on the phone back and forth between Delta Airlines and Delta Vacations). I am still NOT able to use my American Express card.

After all of this fiasco above, all I was offered for the hours of my time, a blocked credit card due to a SEVERE overcharge on Delta’s side, and my years of loyalty to your airline was 5,000 miles. That is LAUGHABLE. Delta gives out 2,500 miles at the drop of a hat for a bag that doesn’t meet the 20 minute baggage guarantee. For all that we had to go through with this, we expect much more from Delta, whether it’s first class upgrades on our flight, an upgrade to our hotel rooms, or something comparable. 

I will be seriously reconsidering flying with Delta going forward after this fiasco, as will my daughter and son, who are both also loyal Platinum Medallion members.","Insanely disappointed in Delta customer service after a $67,000 mischarge to my credit card & hours on the phone.","false","false"

Instead, she was very impolite saying that’s not what she asked for !?!? Eventually ACCUSING me of having an attitude and made me sure that I WON’T CATCH THE FLIGHT from Detroit to LA!!!
As a matter of fact she told her colleague NOT TO  SCAN my boarding pass, she didn’t question anything and completely ignored me when trying to approach the situation.
I was shocked to see the way they were handling things around!!
I felt EMBARRASSED and not counting that I was the one ending up apologizing for any inconvenience created just to make sure that I’d get into that flight!! Their lack of incompetence regarding customer service made the entire moment VERY UNCOMFORTABLE and any of us deserves anything like this!!

We were told that the plane was taken out of service for an ""oil change.""  What??!!  We were now booked on a much later flight bringing us into Atlanta at 11:45 PM.  We suspected the real reason was because we had cashed in our frequent flyer miles and, in the meantime, Delta got paying customers for our seats.  
We are travelers who enjoy giving little treats (candy, snacks, etc.) to our attendants for good service.  Just something to say 'thank you.""  A ""good afternoon"" or ""welcome aboard"" would have been a nice way to start the journey.  Nope.  Not even a ""hello.""  Snacks were brought around in basket without even a ""would you like something?"" being asked.  Seeing that we booked Premium Economy seats, premium snacks and beverages are included.  I felt like the gentleman attendant was offended when I asked for a beer.  And the snacks were not offered before the cart left and that was the last time we saw him.
The legroom. overhead bin space, and early seating does make the premium economy a nice product, however, I expect a little more consideration from the flight crew for what I pay.  In addition, I feel that if a traveler has a flight that will coincide with a dinner time, then a meal should be included without paying extra (especially in 1st or Premium Economy).

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"We've flown Delta for many years, including economy and comfort+ both domestically and internationally. As a special treat, we upgraded to Delta Premium Select on a Aug. 2023 flight from Minneapolis to Amsterdam. Let's compare what was advertised / promised by Delta to what was actually provided during our flight:

What Delta Premium Select promised:
--""accelerated check-in"" and a welcome ""glass of sparkling wine""
--wider seats with adjustable leg and foot rests
--premium amenity kit ""filled with essentials like eye masks, socks and lip balm from Grown Alchemist""
--starting Sept. 20, 2022 ""exclusive snack baskets and upgraded menu choices specially curated for the Delta Premium Select experience"", ""Food is generally of higher quality than what's served in the main cabin""
--""memory-foam pillow,  a plush blanket and noise-canceling headphones, ""
--dedicated flight attendants just for the Delta Premium Select section of the plane

What Delta Premium Select actually offered
--accelerated check-in and only a glass of sparkling wine, no other welcome drink options were available; still, this was a nice feature but only if you like sparkling wine.
--wider seats than economy or comfort+, roughly the same width as US domestic first-class seat that includes (1) slightly more seat recline; and (2) a slightly adjustable leg and foot rests. The wider seats are indeed a nice feature on long international flights.
--premium amenity kit, but no socks; a bamboo toothbrush with a tiny tube of toothpaste; some face cream; and an eye mask don't, in my estimation, qualify as ""premium"".
--the exact same meal selections that were served economy class, except (1) we received a paper menu; (2) the plastic food containers were served on a ceramic tray instead of on a plastic tray; and (3) a small white napkin was laid over the tray table prior to service. The food was very disappointing given the much higher cost of the plane ticket and the advertised and promised higher quality and wider variety of food options. For example, the caprese salad for dinner was inedible and the chicken overly greasy. The breakfast included nothing special: yogurt and a tasteless breakfast sandwich, the exact same food options served in basic economy.
--there were no ""exclusive snacks"", in fact we were only served snacks once early on during the entire flight.
--a pillow that felt the same as any other airline, a very thin blanket, and ""mostly"" noise-canceling headphones; the headphones were a better quality than those available in economy, but it might be better to bring your own high-quality noise canceling headphones.
--while there did appear to be two dedicated  flight attendants just for the Delta Premium Select section of the plane at the start of the flight, during which a complimentary glass of sparkling wine was served, the flight attendants helped out in the other sections including the large economy section and thus were nearly always absent or away from the Premium Select section. As a result, there were none of the ""extras"" served as promised on the Delta website.

Overall, while the larger seat was a nice feature, Delta Premium Select was a waste of money and the overall quality of food, service and extras was very disappointing. If you desire a bit more seat and leg space during a European flight, choose Delta Comfort+ instead and save yourself hundreds of dollars. Although we've flown Delta to Europe for many years, we'll be looking at other airline options for our next flight.","Avoid Delta Premium Select","false","false"

Had to rebook my own flight for the 10th and unable to get a direct flight.  Had to go from DTW to Tampa and a connecting flight with Virgin Atlantic from Tampa to LHR. I was told that I would be assigned seats for the rebooked flights when the gate agent showed before departure. 30 minutes before the flight was to leave  and there was still no agent.  Had to ask someone to get someone at that gate.  And when the person showed up she said she did not realize she was supposed to be there.  She was so lacking in knowledge that she did not know whether I would be assigned seats for my flight from Detroit and the connecting flight to LHR until she input the info in the computer.  I was told I might have to contact the other airline for the connecting flight.   It was stressful enough having one flight cancelled and then  the added concern that I might possibly be stranded in Tampa because this Delta employee did not understand the partnership between Delta and Virgin Atlantic.  Only when the computer spit out  the boarding passes for both flights did she understand what was going on. When we arrived in Tampa my husband asked the gate agent at arrival how to get to Virgin Atlantic gate.  He was told to look at the monitor.  I told the agent that Virgin Atlantic was Delta's partner and he should be able to tell us where the gate is.  He then quickly provided an answer.  My take away from this trip is that Delta employees are unhappy, ill informed and are not customer oriented.  What else can you expect when they work for a company that shows such disrespect for  customers.  Delta provided vouchers for food and some measly air miles.  That did not pay for my prepaid hotel night that I missed in London or prepaid excursions.  Maybe if the DOT made Delta compensate clients like the Canadian Transportation Agency, there might be different outcomes ...  fewer cancelled flights, flights arriving and departing on time. Maybe Ed Bastian should come out from behind his desk and take a look at what is going on with Delta employees and come to the realization that Delta is not customer centric.

He worked alone yet dealt efficiently and appropriately with at least a hundred people.

Most of the time the wifi is not avail or does not work, there is always a Tv broken or a seat that won’t recline and the crew is barely put together and most often rude and unhappy to be working.  I ask myself when did flying become the most dreaded way to travel.

Delta cancelled the flight and told us 4:30 so we had most of the day to wait. That turned into 6:00. Instead of Virginia, you took us to Atlanta where we both had to run from gate B2 to gate A30 (we’re in our 60s). At Gate 30 we were greeted by a large angry black woman who snapped “You have fifteen seconds.” I told her we did not have our seat assignments. She snapped again “I said wait!”. Then up through Tennessee and finally to VA where we landed at midnight. We got our rental car just before midnight. We did not make it to our destination until 4 a.m. So instead of a two-hour flight, it turned into fourteen hours. 

Other Delta flights were leaving throughout the day. We watched as agents offered up to $900 for other flights to go through different hubs. I asked for another hub and got “No”. We lost a day of our vacation thanks to Delta, not the weather. So a lost day of vacation and approximately $400 for booking with Delta.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"On Sunday September 10, my friend and I were returning back to Toronto from LaGuardia airport. We arrive at the airport and are waiting in the bag check line only to see on the screen that our flight was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. This was a surprise to us because we were not notified of this sudden cancellation until we got to the airport. Why not say something earlier or within the day so that we can plan accordingly? Our flights automatically got moved to Tuesday in the evening and we could stay here another day. We finally get to the front of the bag check line and we speak to the lady about the cancellation. Out of the 11 workers we spoke with during our time at the airport, she was one of the nice ones. We asked her if we could get any other flights tonight and she said there were none. She suggested we go to JFK and try but would not compensate us for travel to get there. Our flight was moved to Tuesday and it was Sunday evening. Where were we supposed to stay? They couldn't give us any hotel accommodations or nothing. They couldn't supply us with any solutions or offer to help or service us in any way which is poor customer service. We couldn't afford another night at a hotel so we actually ended up sleeping in the airport. They couldn't even supply blankets or nothing. We were just cold and freezing in the airport while we looked and googled for earlier flights, which are now double and triple the price. I'm talking $1,000 - $1,500 one way for a flight that was originally 300 or so. They couldnt even give us a refund for the flight. They just told us to call customer service. I had to wait 1-2 hours just to get a refund for that flight. So at this point we had to consider taking a bus until we finally found a flight with Delta the following day in the evening around 300. Fast forward to Monday September 11. We check in our bags go through everything and watching netflix by our gate until it was time to board. I think an hour or so before boarding I get an email saying that this flight is now cancelled. My friend and I check the screen and it still says the flight is on time. We went to the people at the gate who had to confirm whether or not the flight was cancelled. At this point we were getting even more frustrated because the same thing happened again. The customer service couldn't do anything for us. AGAIN. They moved our flight to Wednesday September 13. Again, no accomodations, no refund,nothing. The man acted like he did us a favor by giving us a food voucher for $32. What can $32 buy at an airport for 2 people? It was really frustrating because again we werent notified until last minute of this cancellation. We decided to call and get another refund on the flight all while finding a bus that we could take to get home. We found 1 that was leaving at 10 pm and not too far from the airport. We purchased non refundable tickets, desperate to get home and thinking we would get there in time. We decided to get our bags that we checked and just take this bus. We headed to baggage claim and this was what really got me frustrated. We got there and our bags were not there!! We had to wait 4 hours for our suitcases to come out. I asked countless workers where our bags were and we were either dismissed, ignored or not given a direct answer. One girl went as far as to dismiss my question and start helping someone else. Another worker walked right past me when I asked for help. I was told many times that it was in Claim #4 and I checked and there was NO sign of my suitcase. They sent me to claim #4 about 4 times claiming it was there when it wasn't. The suitcases also were coming down quite slowly. It was like 1 suitcase every 2-3 minutes instead of multiple coming one time. It was really inefficient. Some people were told that their baggage was lost. Because baggage check took too long we missed the bus we were supposed to take and had to spend another night at the airport. We ended up taking a 6 am bus to finally get back home in Toronto on Tuesday September 12 around 8 pm. 

Also I was walking through the air port and tripped over the floor (which was uneven) and scraped my knee. Something I was also not compensated for. Thats freaking law suit!

We were flying back from MQT Michigan back to Chicago via Detroit last July 13th. We decided that we will just pay the rebooking fee and fare difference (which is not a small amount of money) to ensure to arrive in ORD on the 13th. After calling the customer service and paying everything, we were notified that MQT-DTW flight will be delayed and found out at the airport that it  is due to mechanical error. The delay led us missing our DTW-ORD flight so they book us to the next day flight. Basically we paid for a rebooking fee and fare difference for nothing. In transit, I called the CS team several times to inquire about the refund for the rebooking fee. The first call was disconnected and the second person I spoke to, he said that he won't be able to file the request for refund because we are still in transit and that I have to call once we reached ORD.  So I followed the instruction and contacted the CS team both by email and phone but they keep on rejecting our request for refund and telling us that we were no longer eligible because the flight has been completed which contradicts what we have been told the first time we called.

If asked the simplest of questions, his attitude was disgraceful and looked like he was ready for an argument. 

Firstly, I ordered a glass of water from him and then asked if it would be him who takes the rubbish or another attendant to which HE SNIGGERED AND SAID, “DOES IT LOOK LIKE I’M TAKING RUBBISH?”.

I replied, “This is why I’m asking you, to find out if you are, or if it’ll be someone else”.

I was totally shocked and replied, “I CAN’T BELIEVE SOMEONE IN YOUR POSITION WOULD THINK IT’S OK TO SPEAK TO A PAYING PASSENGER LIKE THIS” to which HE REPLIED THAT I HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME & POINTED TO HIS BRAIN!!

He continued to serve the woman next to me and just ignored me, so I asked him if he intended giving me my water to which he just POINTED AT ME AND ABRUPTLY SHOUTED “WAIT!!”.

After a couple of minutes, he poured my water but then, on leaving, he PUSHED HIS TROLLEY INTO MY SEAT IN ANGER AND IT CAUGHT MY ARM WHICH SUSTAINED A BRUISE AFTERWARDS.

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"We flew Delta from SLC to SGU on 9/10/23. We had not done this flight since they rebuilt the SLC airport and the process of getting to your airplane and getting to your gate has gone way down hill.
First if flying from SLC to SGU be aware you will need to take a bus from Terminal B (the gate B25/26/27 area) to your plane and that  the bus doesn't fit all the passengers the plane can, so expect multiple buses and no room for your carry on luggage.
Our bus ride (Gate 26 to plane) took 15 min. (time we boarded bus to time we got to the plane) and then we waited for another bus so all the passengers could get on. The process delayed our flight 30 min. 
If you are doing the reverse and flying SGU to SLC expect to wait on the plane for the bus or buses needed to take you to the terminal. 
It is an awful system.
Second,once you are at the gate  expect to walk one mile from your gate to the SLC exit or if you are flying to SGU, one mile from when you enter SLC to get to the B25/26/27 gate area where the bus to the plane leaves from. There are some moving walkways but it's a long and slow process to get to the gate. 
There is no tram available. Bad planning by the SLC airport management.

If you must fly to SGU, we'd recommend flying United from Denver or American from PHX (and we normally like flying Delta). 
If you fly into Las Vegas you get more flight options but it is  a 2 to 2.5 hour drive or shuttle ride to St. George (3 to 3.25 hr to Zion)  but flying to LAS is generally cheaper and has more direct flights.

Just avoid SLC to SGU or SGU to SLC for the next few years until the next construction phase is complete and the buses are gone and a tram is available.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"Have flown Delta for 15 years internationally & they've had their issues as their international flight attendants are awarded these routes based on seniority so you get some older miserable attendants that have compelled me to fly some of the Asian carriers as service is much better & their attendants aren't cantankerous as Delta's are.

The bigger issue is Delta lost my luggage on my flight from Seattle to Seoul where I was to make my connection on Vietnam Airways. Not only did Delta lose my luggage they delayed us leaving Seattle by two hours so I missed my connection.

Once arriving in Seoul & missing my connection my Delta App failed to work outside of the U.S. so was tedious to know if I'd been rebooked. Finally I was confirmed on a Korean Air flight to Saigon. Problem was my luggage didn't make it to Saigon so i arrived at 2 A.M. to spend two hours on the phone with Delta as they had no idea where my luggage was.

I had to go buy some basic toiletries & some slacks/shirt for my conference. Returned that night & another two hours on the phone with Delta who told me my luggage was on it's way & to contact Vietnam Airlines. Well Vietnam Airlines & Korean Air told me they never received my luggage in Seoul.

After two days I had to go buy additional clothes for my five day conference. After five days & knowing I had a flight to additional meetings in the U.S. i needed luggage which Delta again told me my luggage would arrive the night before I left which it didn't. 

So I ended up needing luggage to take materials from my conference & cloths back to my next business meeting. Of course my luggage never arrived before I departed Vietnam or did it make it to me the next two weeks.

Trying to get reimbursed for my expenses for clothing etc for my trip Delta passed me  onto Korean Air as they said the terms of service said they were the finally carrier & hence responsible for my reimbursement. Calling Korea air they said where I was a Delta Gold member they'd give me $200.... the luggage I bought at the closet store near my hotel was over $200 & now with cloths (slacks, belt, shoes, socks, & four shirts) I was pushing over $1,000.

Delta stuck with me around $900 for my lost/delayed luggage of 20 days & after spending over 10 hours on the phone pleading my case Delta FAILED to deliver.

Our Detroit to Salt Lake flight boarded on time and left the gate trying to beat a thunderstorm. Unfortunately, just before takeoff we were notified we were on hold till storm passed. It was rather warm on the plane and the storm was going strong outside. Two passengers demanded to go back to the terminal and after much negotiation even though the storm had passed we had to go back to the terminal. An hour later, the two passengers got off the plane. 
In the meantime, many passengers smelled a horrible rotten egg smell (including me) which was reported to maintenance. After another half hour, it was determined we needed a new plane. It is now late into the night and everyone is clearly missing their connecting flights in Salt Lake. We were directed to a new gate an hour later.

Download the Fly Delta application which is useful.  I could choose my seats in advance free of charge on the fare I had which was nice so I booked a window seat for all four flights.  I could also include one bag to check-in without a fee.  Flights departed on time, boarding was done in a timely manner, staff and cabin crew were all generally very friendly and pleasant especially on the longer flights from London to NYC and NYC to London.  We landed on time and even early sometimes.  Boarding and disembarking were quick.  My luggage arrived in a timely manner at each destination.  Can't complain.  I booked an economy seat.  My negatives, food was awful.  So much cheese on everything and so unhealthy.  I decided to order a vegetarian meal on my way back which was much better!  Order a special meal.  I found it strange that we didn't get a bread roll with our meals as airlines always give this.  Planes were not the most comfortable.  Legroom was quite tight and not very spacious.  In-flight entertainment was average.  Some good movies and music.  You can purchase wifi or it is free I believe for some guests.  I didn't bother.  Planes were reasonably clean.  There are charging sockets which are useful.  For the shorter flights from NYC to Bogota and Bogota to NYC, the planes were very basic and really uncomfortable.  Serving also took ages.  Airlines need to serve quicker especially on overnight flights as people want to sleep.  I never get why they serve breakfast or a snack like an hour before landing and then you have to rush to eat it as the plane starts to land and the cabin crew need to prepare the aircraft for landing.  Serve it earlier.  I travel a lot.  This is around the twenty something flight I have done this year and my god the turbulence coming into London from JFK was bad.  Thanks to good pilots.  I am grateful.  I would otherwise recommend Delta.  They just need to revamp their food menu and upgrade their planes.  One thing, I had a very long layover in JFK on both legs, over 12 hours.  If you have the same, you will need to check-in for each leg separately.  Normally, you can check-in right through to the final destination.  Going out, my flight arrived late in the evening and my bag could not go through to the final destination.  I had to collect it.  I went to a hotel overnight and then had to check-in again for my second flight to Colombia the next morning.  Coming back, the bag went straight through to London but I had to collect the bag in the USA and clear it through customs first.  Basically wait for your bag as normal, follow the signs and go through security and then hand the bag to a member of staff so it goes through to the final destination.  I checked in online again for both flights separately.  Very easy to do.  The USA often change their rules for transit requirements.  I have done it many times and I have had bags go all over the place on some trips, as I didn't clear them through customs.  The above is at September, 2023 but check before your flight.

travellers were helped as and when there flight was due. I thought it strange 
when a helper told a 19:00 take off passenger that someone would collect him soon. I went to the help desk  and asked if anything was wrong. They told me they had just been informed that the flight had just been  cancelled, but they didn't have any information on it yet. I went back to the waiting area to tell the other passengers that the flight had just been cancelled but there was no other information. my wife told me she had been talking to my daughter in the UK and been informed that the flight had been cancelled at 
15:00 for at least 12 hours. Just then helpers came to take us to the gate. When we told him that it had been cancelled , he said nobody had informed nim of that.

Her ticket to Florence was complicated, because we booked it through a third party and she had both Delta and Air France legs and so getting her rerouted was very difficult.  The two reservations specialists on the phone went out of their way to help, calling Air France and making a lot of exceptions for her in order to get her to her destination.  Then at the Airport, the gate agents were still having difficulty getting her onboard due to her complicated ticket and they also had to get on the phone with Air France and override a bunch of issues.  They ended up holding the door for her (the flight still left on time, but it was pushing it) while figuring it out and getting her to Italy, when they could have just told her she was out of luck.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Delta’s slogan is “The world’s most trusted airline”? What an absolute crock! I can’t believe how this company operates is even legal, their airline customer service is by far the worst that I have ever experienced.  I am absolutely disgusted with Delta Air Lines, they absolutely ruined the first day of vacation for my family and myself. Around 2:00AM on July 27th my family and I were on a shuttle bus heading to DIA for our 5:30 AM early bird flight, and we received a notification through the Delta app our 5:30AM flight had been delayed over 7 hours until 1:00PM…….7 HOURS!!! This changed our entire travel day and immediately the panic set it, and we were all on our phones looking to see what other flight options we had to get to Knoxville, TN to start our family vacation. Because of the delay, we all realized after only moments of searching that from what we could find in our search, our SINGLE option for our connection flight put us into TN at 11 PM at night or next day. We decided to go to the airport and talk with the Delta desk attendants at the check-in counter. We waited in line for an hour and a half only to get to the front and be told the attendants were only checking bags, and that we could only rebook flights using the computer kiosks or by calling Delta customer service. We called customer service and ended up booking the only other Delta flight option which required a 3 hour layover and us still landing in TN at 11 PM at night. We were growing very concerned because we had an afternoon of activities planned once we landed including an already paid for Zipline excursion and dinner reservations and we explained that to the customer service representative. She told us it sounded as though it was worth checking other airlines to see if we could get a different flight. Our next question was then how do we get a refund for our flight, in which she told us she could not do anything about and that we should ask the Delta attendant at our gate if they could assist us in getting a refund. We went airline to airline and there were nearly no other flights except on American airlines which still did not take off 4 hours after our original Delta flight, putting us 4 hours behind on the day. We booked with AA, and went to our original Delta Airlines gate where we stood in line for over an hour. The Delta attendants notified the crowd on the speak that the flight had been overbooked and that they were offering 1200 dollar travel vouchers for volunteers to rebook on a later flight that took off 2 hours later. They let the 6 or so people cut the line so they could rebook them and give them vouchers, all the while we stood in line just trying to get some help on our flight that was delayed 7 hours. Once we got to the desk, again we were told they could do nothing about rebooking the flight due to limited options and that they could not offer a refund and that we needed to call customer service. At this point, we had spent somewhere around 4 hours waiting in line at the Delta check-in counters. We decided at that point we had not other options and went to the food court to wait another 2 hours for our American Airlines flight. During our wait we decided to call Delta customer service again to ask about a refund like we were instructed to do, and after waiting on hold for 30 minutes we got a service rep to answer the call. They told us we would be refunded but they couldn’t issue the refund without canceling our flights back home and recommended we not submit refund request until we got home. We asked about them covering our American Airline flight or providing a travel voucher for the inconvenience like they did for others, and we were told Delta would provide that if approved by a customer service manager but not until we got back from our vacation to make sure our return flight went as planned. We missed out on 5 hours of vacation on our first vacation day and our zipline excursion thanks to Delta. Our short trip went by and the flights home went almost as planned (45 minute delay), and have now made multiple attempts to talk with customer service representatives to get them to follow through on what we were told. We are getting the run around. The first individual we spoke with when we got back and called customer service told us that the previous rep we spoke to while at the airport a week before did not input any notes in the system under our travel confirmation number. We had to explain it all again, and she said she would file for the refund but recommended we wait to request Delta pay for the American Airline flight or request a voucher. Two weeks went by and we finally received a refund which wasn’t even half the cost of our original ticket. I called again, and the next lady told me that with the airport fees and taxes, Delta refunded exactly half the cost of the ticket. I then asked if they would pay for the AA flight like we were told or be given travel vouchers and she said she could not do any sort of refund like that and in order to be helped we had to file a complaint on Delta’s website. I did that that night, filled out the form with our story and flight information and waited two weeks before calling again tonight with my case number. The customer “care” representative told me my case number included none of the information about my previous flights and she had to search the flight itinerary all over again, but at least made mentioned there were notes in the system and she could see that we had called previously in regard to a refund. I asked her tonight about Delta paying for the AA flight or if they could give us a voucher for the inconvenience due to the “mechanical issue” that was a direct breach of Delta’s ability to service us as paying customers. She told us that Delta does not provide vouchers or pay for other airline tickets, which is exactly opposite of what I was told nearly a month prior. After explaining to her that Delta does indeed give out travel vouchers for the inconvenience, she proceeded to get snippy with me and tell me she has worked at Delta 25 years and she has never heard of them providing vouchers. She then in a smart tone responded “We provide gift certificates for people who are marked as “did not board” due to volunteering to take different flights when flights are overbooked. I wanted to explode, I told her that was what exactly I was talking about. I asked why is it that Delta offers 1200 dollar vouchers for passengers to volunteer to take different flights and change their travel plans, when we did NOT volunteer but were delayed twice as long and she was refusing to give us any sort of compensation. When I asked her how that made any sense, her response was “I’m sorry” in a sarcastic tone. I then escalated the conversation politely and requested a customer service manager, and she told me that Delta does not have customer service managers that will take phone calls to talk with customers. She then reiterated that everything we had been told was false and Delta essentially has no responsibility to follow through on paying for the AA flight or providing a “gift certificate”. She said I could call corporate to speak with them but they would just read to me the Delta policies and I would be told the same thing. So….after all this, I have spent hours on hold and waiting in line, the first day of our vacation was ruined, we paid 500 dollars more a person for the change in flights, and not a single Delta customer service representative wanted to help a paying customer out for the crappy experience. Instead we were met with lack of respect for our time and money, disregard and neglect for our situation that their own “mechanical issue” put us through, and zero accountability. This is pure negligence on Delta Air Lines. I would not recommend them to anyone nor will I ever give them my business again. I am going to continue to file a claim with the DOT and BBB as well.

My husband and I were furious because nothing was announced, nor was our name called to let us know of the last minute change. My husband attempted to ask the Delta Rep when did the flight change? She rudely stated, I don't know sir. All I know is the flight gate was changed to E10, they were to depart at 9:45 am, but they departed earlier. My husband asked, what time did they depart? She stated at 9:43 sir. Please move out of the line. We missed our flight. We went to the Delta desk and the agent was no better. We advised her of what had happened and she said, I don't see that your flight was changed to another gate? She then kept looking and said, oh yeah, at the last minute they changed it, and you and your wife are listed as a no show. By this time we are heartbroken. We asked if there was another flight going out? She responded not today. We called our travel agent and she got a Delta Rep on the line for Delta Vacations and she was very unsympathetic. Our travel agent kept asking what could we do to fix this? The agent stated for us to go back to the Delta desk and see if they could book us on an other flight. We again advised we were told there were no more flights going out. We went back to the Delta help desk and the agent had the nerve to say: I don't know why they sent you back to me. They can see the same thing I can. She repeated that statement six times before saying there was nothing she could do.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"After arriving late to Delta for a previously scheduled flight to New York from LAX, I asked for a refund for the flight and was willing to pay the difference for a flight that took me to another airport at New York earlier at a different time. Seems like a simple enough request, but the agents instead insisted I rebook a flight that went through the exact same airports, including the layover. I couldn’t even pick a different path and pay for it, the system did not allow it. I had a wedding to attend at 6pm the next day, rather than arriving at 11am, I would arrive at 4:30pm. Seems reasonable, even though I would have preferred to arrive into New York earlier.

The check-in was closed for the night and I ended up having to sleep on the floor at LAX until they opened at 3:45 AM. This was uncomfortable for a variety of reasons, but after using the self-check in kiosk to print my new bag tags and boarding passes, it required an agent to check me in. Into the queue I had to go… where there was only 1 agent and a long line. A supervisor came to help out, saying that I was dumb not to use the self check in kiosk, but saw the same issues I saw. He quickly apologized, and that whole situation took an hour to resolve when it should have taken seconds. I don’t believe checking baggage weight and ID is a particularly time-consuming process, yet Delta has found a way to make it time-consuming. 

I almost ended up missing the first flight set to depart at 5:40 am. Turns out, the flight crew also almost missed the flight too. The flight was delayed, from 6:40, 6:50, 7:05, 7:20, and every minute after that until 7:30. The whole time, the announcements were pretty callous.

I had a connecting flight that left at 2:48 that would bring me into New York at 4:30. Delta missed this flight with flying colors, and the next flight was auto-booked at 9:15pm to 10:45pm. Completely missed the wedding. Could not book any alternative flights to any other airport nearby to get there earlier. What a joke. 

Even though I know I could avoid this by arriving a few minutes earlier to drop off my bag for the original flight, Delta should not have messed up this badly. 

Luckily, if Delta disrupts your travel plans by 3+ hours, you get a meal voucher. But missing a wedding this huge costs way more than some meal voucher.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"In June my husband and I were scheduled to fly on AA from Tyler, TX to Las Vegas. Our flight from Tyler was delayed and by the time we reached Dallas our flight to LAS was cancelled. As we were unable to secure an AA flight for the next 24 hours we turned to Delta. I pulled up the fight schedule for the following morning and easily located two economy seats. Each ticket was a little over $800. I was not given an option to select our seat assignments but just figured we handle it the next morning. Upon checking in and arriving at the gate I approached the gate agent. She was very friendly, extremely helpful and assigned us our seats for the DFW to Atlanta leg. She advised us to speak with the gate agent in Atlanta as soon as they arrived at the gate to get our seat assignment. I approached the agent as soon as he arrived and I was told that he was sick of “them” telling people to get a seat assignment from him. He told me to sit down and when it was our turn to board he’d call us by name. I did as I was told and waited. As the plane was rapidly filling to capacity I approached him again to be certain we had not been overlooked. He hatefully advised me that he had already told me to wait so I should just sit back down and wait….he’d get to me. Again, we can tell that most of the plane is full and he has started to ask people to give up seats for compensation and a later flight. We hear at least 8 passengers called to board after we’ve heard them say they were stand by or were hoping  to get on the flight because of an earlier cancellation. Again, I approach the agent and politely tell him that I can tell the flight is almost full and that I have 2 purchased tickets and he is calling stand by before he is calling us to board. For the third time I’m told to “just wait”.  He then fills the last two seats and it’s not with us! By this time we aren’t very happy. He ends up removing two of the stand bys that he has seated before us and calls us to the boarding area. We are assigned seats in row 17 at this point and board the plane. As we get to the seats we see that only one of the seats is empty. So we approach the flight attendant who looks at the seat assignment and then asks us if we want to do separate flights. We tell her absolutely not! They finally find a seat for my husband at the back of the plane. As I visited with the woman in the seat my husband was assigned I find out she wasn’t even originally scheduled for this flight. It was impossible not to notice that the agent and  everyone boarded before us that didn’t even have flights booked for this specific flight was of a different race than we were. I’m not one to scream racial profiling but the situation was clear. After we returned home I filed a complaint with Delta. The treatment we received from this gate agent was horrible. More than a month later I receive a response from Delta. I’m first told that they strive to be a leader in diversity and they are sorry we believe they fell short. Then they tell me that they reached out to the Atlanta Customer Service leadership who in turn asked the employee on duty if he recalled this incident. Believe it  or not, he doesn’t remember this. Like they seriously think he’s going to admit it! Then they tell me we were given upgraded seats. Ummm, hello. I was in row 17, my husband was at the very back of the plane. That certainly wasn’t an upgrade. Their records still showed that he had been in the row 17 seat next to me. They apparently don’t even know the name of the person sitting in his assigned seat! So, why was she placed there before we were? I have a pretty good idea. They then have the nerve to tell me, “We know you have a choice when you travel, so thanks for choosing Delta”. Well, I can certainly tell you who will never choose Delta again!","1st and last Delta flight","false","false"
"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I had tickets with my very young kids (1,2 & 5) on one reservation to fly from Miami to Warsaw connecting via NY and Amsterdam. The system didn’t allow me to check in online the day before. So I was early at the airport the next day. At the checking desk the lady informed me that she is not able to assign me seats and that I need to leave her desk and see the gate agent. At the gate the agent told me that he doesn’t have my seats and that I will be lucky if I get all 4 as the plane was oversold. I’ve asked if he is planning to leave the mother or one of my kids behind. He asked me to leave. After 20 mins he called me and without the word gave me 4 boarding passes. When I checked them I noticed that all of us were separated including 1 & 2 years old. When I asked him to help me to change it he said that he can’t do anything for me and that I should be grateful that I can board this plane. On board I asked one of the flight attendants to help me fix it and I heard that I can ask people to move. When I did, just one person agreed to switch places and I was able to seat my daughters together. But still my one year old and I were separated. Then the flight attendant started speaking to my one year old “Sir, please close the table for take off. Sir, you must follow the federal regulations.” Without even trying to help my son who being one is not able to follow those instructions without his mother next to him. Then the flight attendant said that my kids are not suited for air travel (they fly overseas every 4-6 months) and that he will report me to the pilot and that I will have to leave the plane. Pilot said that he is returning to the gate and that if he does it he won’t be able to fly this plane as his work time will be over. At that moment few passengers decided to switch seats with me and my kids. When we arrive in NY there was no gate available for our flight and we had to wait, my 2 years old had to go to the bathroom, same flight attendant refused to let her few times, finally when I told him that 2 years old will just pee on the seat he let her go to bathroom with the comment that we are just causing problems. Next flight was extremely delayed, but a very nice gate agent helped me change my seats, so we are comfortable on the overnight flight. 

On the way back we were informed the day earlier that we were rebooked for a different flight to go home due to aircraft change, but my husband’s reservation (GFVB3K) which was linked to mine and kids was not. When we called we were told that he would need to pay $700 to rebook his reservation and that Delta can’t do anything about it. Again I was not able to check in online and when I got to the airport the check in agent said that my reservation was wrong and that she will be able to check me in just for my 1st leg Warsaw Paris and that in Paris I have to resolve that issue with the gate agent. Landing in Paris and trying to pass immigration I had an issue as they didn’t want to let me pass as I didn’t have the boarding pass. Finally after speaking with a few agents they let me. When I got to the gate I got boarding passes again with all of us sitting separately. Gate agent was really rude and said that she can’t do anything about it. On board I was passed from one flight attendant to another. The one assigned to my area was the only one who was trying to help. We were able to talk to people and get 3 out of 4 seats together. After some time I was told that I can’t use my 4th seat because Air France requires car seats for kids under 2 to use their seat. So I’ve requested a refund of this seat/ticket (claim # C - 6749640 fialed with Air France). When the food arrived I was told that as the craw submitted the refund request one of us won’t get food as the 4th seat was canceled. 

Both ways the trip was a nightmare.

My Oh! so long legs never fit in the allotted exiguous seat allowance, and so despite being as mindful as possible of where my knees are they always get walloped by the trolleys and their dollies. This flight was no exception, and where most stewards are mindful, the Atlanta crew were careless, couldn't get their trollies down without play-acting bumper cars with them, and their wide loads they personally carry also knocking peoples arms, shoulders and knees accordingly. It's time to stop pandering to overweight people who are not suitable for certain jobs, and tell them if they want to work in confined spaces they should loose some weight. I'm not surprised they were all so fat; I saw them all tucking into the poisonous food on offer with alacrity, none of it designed to be healthy. The vouchers offered by Delta for flight alterations are unable to be redeemed unless you put them against another flight. With that experience this is unlikely.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"We had a 3:30 pm flight from SKB to ATL on 8/5/23 that was THREE hours delayed and communicated with the passengers ZERO!  There was not one Delta person you could find at the airport to ask anything regarding the flight and ZERO announcements about the flight were made until one hour PAST the departure time.  ZERO communication, announcements or help until an agent arrived at 4:30 pm (1 hour passed departure time) where all she said was ""if you have a digital boarding pass come to the gate"", at which point everyone got up and started storming the area.  
We got on the plane and proceeded to sit there on the plane in the heat for TWO HOURS.  Again, no communications once boarded until 5:00 pm when the attendant stated we would be leaving shortly.  We did not leave till 6:30 pm not sure if attendant could not tell time or clearly had no clue what was going but how is 1 1/2 hours translate to leaving shortly.  The only way we kind of knew what was going on were the passengers boarding who told us that persons who did not have a digital pass had a handwritten one and that Delta was doing a sort of roll call at the gate to get the those handwritten boarding pass holders on the flight.  So, after waiting 1 hour passed boarding time with no communication this is your bright idea?  
After finally getting everyone on we then had to taxi for takeoff and the already warm plane was now getting hot to the point of non-breathable air.  I felt uneasy, lightheaded and anxious to the point of fainting. 
SO the 3:30 pm flight left at 6:30 pm and we have been at the airport since 11:30 am.  Attendants did not seem phased, did not apologize nor did they try to make a bad situation somewhat better.  We are starving and I use the call button that takes someone 20 mins to respond to asking for a bistro or market box as the sun chips that contain 5 chips in them will not work and he says he will be back.  20 more minutes go by and I hit the call button again where a woman comes, and I tell her I have been waiting for more than 20 mins for a box as my family is starving and off she goes to ask the man (who was supposed to be helping me) for her ONLY to come back to tell me they have ZERO boxes on the plane for purchase.  Does anyone at Delta besides the pilot know how to do their job?  
NO communication, delays, sitting on tarmac in the heat for hours and no food for purchase.  I could not have gotten worse service if I tried.  I spent over $1000 pp to fly on Delta and this is your best?!? You rely on your customers, and this is how you treat them??!!
Lastly, we missed our connection (SHOCKER – NOT) and again zero regard for everyone on the plane missing a connection (which were most), helping with hotels/cars or something as it is now 10:40 pm.  We were offered no vouchers of any sort either.   Not even were we told where we could go to get help once we got off.  All that was said to us upon exiting the plane was ""Thanks for flying please fill out the survey"", beyond laughable.
How an airline can be that inconsiderate, that unhelpful and literally not interested in their customer is mind boggling and appalling! 
Our missed flight was scheduled for 7:30 am the next day and we were left to figure it out on our own.  No hotel vouchers, no food vouchers literally nothing!

When I woke up I asked the flight attendant if I could have water as she was making her trash pick up rounds.  It was approximately 25-30 minutes before our landing time so I told her 'no rush' since I knew she was making her rounds.  She looked at me and said, 'we're about to land'. I am a frequent flyer and I have NEVER been made to feel uncomfortable for a cup of water. I responded with, 'you know what, it's fine. I don't need it.'  Another flight attendant brought me a cup once she was done with her rounds.  Seriously, that's all she needed to do.

The agent completely ruined our experience. It was not until I arrived at the airport for check in that I was told there was a $300 fee ($150 each way) for the unaccompanied minors. I have sent them on other airlines without this charge. 
In addition to that, the return flight was booked as the last flight out. It’s Delta policy that they cannot take the last flight in case something happened and the minors were stranded. Makes complete sense, but again we were not informed of this issue when the DELTA AGENT booked it for us. This caused us to reschedule to another day, waste trips and parking fees to the airport, and take another day off work. 

So a rundown of surprise expenses due to the inept booking agent:
Minor fee- $300
Airport parking- $30
Gas and taking time off work- $$

The airport agents were extremely understanding but limited with what they could offer.

It cancelled at around 9:00. We had the chance to reschedule in Venice as our departure from there was delayed an hour making our time to clear customs pretty tight. The supervisor there advised us to keep our original flight as the pilot might be able to make up time in the air and our connection might get delayed, and that if anything went wrong Delta would take care of us. Boy was she wrong. Everyone piled into line for customer service. It was clear immediately that the reps hated their jobs. They didn't give a flying rip about their customers. We waited in line for an hour to see an agent. While in line they kept trying to give out green cards to people with the customer service phone number on it so they wouldn't have to deal with them. Of course they didn't tell you it would be over a three hour wait to talk with someone. When we finally reached an agent I mentioned it seemed like a rough night. He blurted out not really since he was going home in a few minutes, right in front of a bunch of people who weren't. They let us know the next available flight was in two day, and since it was weather related we could sleep in the terminal. Anything else was our problem as it wasn't their responsibility. No hotel, no food, no compensation, no nothing. Sucks to be you was the attitude. I asked to see the supervisor who made it clear that this was our problem not theirs. He offered us a cab voucher if we could find a hotel room but I told him to keep it as the cab was the least of our problems. My wife told me that after I turned away he gave me the middle finger salute. The hotels around the airport started jacking their prices with all the cancellations, upward of $500 per night. We had to take one in the financial district to get something reasonable. We then had to go to baggage claim to get our luggage and we're told it would be a three hour wait.

Well, we achieved the first goal; we always sit up front in Comfort + in order to not check out luggage and have assigned seating. The second goal, arriving on time eludes us. Ya see, Denver to Minneapolis can nearly be driven as fast as you can fly there and this flight proved that again. Think about it. 1 hour to drive to the airport and park, 2  hours early for the flight, a two hour flight, an hour getting the rental car and you are up to 6-7 hours if everything goes right. It's about a 13 hour drive without too much stress; I've been doing it for 40 years. So, we only fly it when we are tight on time. The Sunday night flights almost always result in a fail wether on Southwest or Delta. We got on the train at 2:00 p.m. from Union Station Downtown Denver and ended up getting home at 1:30 in the morning; you get the math, we could almost have driven it in the same amount of time and had our car the whole time in Denver. Our best tip is try to get out of Denver as early in the day as you can without ruining your vacation because Sunday night at Denver International is a circus. In fairness to Delta, they did give a meal voucher that we couldn't use because it was too bumpy and supplied snacks and drinks at the airport. The in-flight entertainment is the same as if you rented something out of ""Red Box"" at the gas station.

The series of unfortunate events, such as my checked bag being destroyed, the delayed gates at Saint Martin airport, and the off-path routing to Atlanta, left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied with the airline’s services.

Moreover, the 40-minute wait on the runway in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of timely updates on my later flight’s status, made the entire trip feel disorganized and poorly managed.

As a result of this experience, I am left with a strong impression that Delta Airlines does not prioritize the comfort and convenience of their passengers. Regrettably, I have lost confidence in their ability to provide a reliable and smooth travel experience.

Given the frustrations and inconveniences I encountered, I am seriously reconsidering my travel options, and at this point, I would prefer to opt for alternative means of transportation, such as driving, than flying with Delta Airlines again.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"My experience with Delta Airlines was an absolute nightmare, and I want to emphasize that missing my flight from Atlanta to Cancun was entirely Delta's fault. The domino effect of their mismanagement began with my flight from Nice to Atlanta, which departed over an hour late. To add insult to injury, it took us more than 30 minutes to deboard the plane upon landing.

Upon arrival in Atlanta, I faced a harrowing ordeal with visa and security checks, which swallowed up over an hour of precious time. The delays caused by Delta's inefficiency and lack of coordination led to my missed connection to Cancun.

Delta's apathy and lack of assistance further exacerbated the situation. Despite explaining how their own delays resulted in my missed connection, they flatly refused to take responsibility or offer any form of reimbursement.

As a consequence of their negligence, I was left with a litany of financial losses. I had already pre-paid for a hotel and car rental in Cancun, both of which I could no longer use. And, if that wasn't enough, I had no choice but to pay for another hotel if I didn't want to sleep on the airport floor.

The inconvenient waste of time, the financial burden, and the sheer frustration of the entire experience have left me utterly disillusioned with Delta Airlines. Their lack of punctuality, poor customer service, and refusal to rectify their mistakes are inexcusable.

If you value your time, money, and sanity, I implore you to avoid Delta Airlines at all costs.

My family's flight from Austin to Boston was rerouted to Buffalo because we were told we were running out of fuel. We were told we simply needed to refuel and then we could complete our flight to Boston, yet were were stuck on the tarmac for an additional 2 hours. Traveling with two young kids, it took prodding from the passengers to allow them to use the bathroom, have snacks, and receive water. We had to deboard and our flight was subsequently cancelled. We received a $200 voucher credit, which incidentally wouldn't have even covered the cost of our original flight. I give Delta credit for comping our hotel room for the night, but afterwards we were essentially abandoned in Buffalo 700 miles from our destination.

So we had 1 day in Buffalo to spend until our flight early the following morning. I visited the Delta desk in Buffalo and said that my family needed a car to get around for the day, and the manager assured us that Delta would reimburse my family for this cost.

I was never offered comfort at the gate nor on the flight for the inconvenience. Not one voucher or appropriate compensation was offered. Imagine being given the runaround by agents at the gate and customer care just to find out the following day none of the 7 phone calls to customer care on my travel day were EVER documented. Delta you should be ashamed that you cannot live up to the loyalty and funds your consumer provides you. Being offered only $75 dollars worth in SkyMiles or $175 gift card is insane when you have spent well over $400 combined. After I specifically a supervisor today that yesterday a representative offered $250, she told me verbatim the because it was not documented she cannot accommodate me. Yet, with no hesitations the supervisor tells me if decline her today she will have to document this. Honestly is this how you all treat your consumers? Its truly disheartening the only solution this airline has for me is to fill out a complaint comment and wait and wait when I have waited more than enough on July 30,2023. It is clear to me that the airline does NOT CARE!","RECONSIDER ANOTHER AIRLINE!","false","false"

We have been using a good $10-20k a month on our card, we pay $550 a year and have never had an upgrade or been treated like a status they claim, no VIP, no Standby upgrades, 
It’s all a load of hype with no outcomes and only empty hopes and promises. When you call, everyone just passes you on to someone else with no solutions! The accommodations were lacking and unorganized. Waiting in line for 2 hours at an airport after flights were delayed so long we missed our connecting flight, then 4 hours at baggage to wait for missed plane luggage! To finally get our luggage that was damaged, I had no medication for way to long. By 1am we could not find any place to accept the food voucher, there was no shuttle to go to a hotel delta gave us 30 mins away by the time we finally got a hotel, my bags were damaged and we were promised to be compensated to make up for these troubles and NOW they are not offering anything close to fair. 

After one hour on the phone, 3 agents, multiple answers, no help, we were passed to the lowest customer service Delta rep I have ever spoke with! This did the final for me, so inexperienced yo handle any situations for a stressed out and upset customer who has been through the loop holes to try to get reimbursed and her attitude was just nasty and “RUDE”!
Her time was, she didn’t give a Royal crap, as a top customer service agent who says she makes all the Decisions by the name of TAMMY IN ATLANTA- that’s all the info she would give me and with a sarcastic “to bad” I’m the one in power attitude and your not getting anything else besides your reimbursement on food, Uber and damaged luggage.
WOW!!?? SO DISAPPOINTING THATS WHO THEY HAVE ON THW OTHER END TO HELP WHAT A JOKE DELTA AND 
Put it this way I didn’t even get close to what I pay them per year to hold the AX card and statuses, so what’s the point of paying a ton yearly to maintain card, status, AX, points, miles and expecting top notch service-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!??

Delta is horrible and don’t listen to the customer, they also are not accommodating to people who have been through a tough time during their DELTA flight issues and especially the after the flight issues!I am not a happy Delta member.

we should look into because of the whole process of this last month with Delta and how they have been handling our situation is the worst experience I have ever had, ruining our family experience that is so hard to have and put together with our demanding schedules these days of precious time and a waste of my sanity and yearly money for the NONEXISTENT HYPE AND PERKS THEY CLAIM!

None of flights were on time.
In JFK we missed 2 flights trying to re-check in due to first flight 8 hours delayed which caused us to miss the JRO connection. We had to stay in a hotel 2 nights in order to be re booked to JRO.
They have a policy , nothing in writing anywhere, you must have the credit card used for the ticket purchased with you in order to Check in. They can deny you boarding,
And we were denied boarding, until I asked if the receipt on the Delta site was sufficient. It was but we would have missed the flight and missed hotel and Safari in  Tanzania, all paid for. The Web Site receipt has no credit card information on it.
The 8 hour delay caused us to miss the first flight to AMS, and Customer Service caused us to miss a second flight. We finally did get on the later flight and finally got to JRO 2 days late.
Why fly Delta? We will not ever risk missing things we have paid and planned,
It is a joke of a Company and Airline, I am warning people about this Policy that is not in writing anywhere and not enforced except in certain Markets.

To start, my flight was delayed out of Paris, thanks for that. Next, I get re-booked for my connecting flight. Unfortuantly upon Atlanta arrival we were in able to connect the gang way to the plane for over 30 minutes which caused me to miss my FIRST re book. therefore they re booked me for the last flight out of Atlanta to my home city. Next, the luggage took over 45 minutes to appear on the term style which again after obtaining your luggage you have  to put on the term style to your home city, then having to go to customs , passport control, and then ANOTHER tsa check, which created another miss flight to my home town. I attempted to run at record breaking speed to my gate to somehow think after all this chaos I can make my second re booked flight, but unfortunately upon arrival the door was closed so I was not able to make it. I asked for a red coat and he told me quote “since I have been in the airport for over 1 hr 45 mins I was in able to have complementary hotel accommodations” luckily for me there was a women flight attendant at the desk who heard my story and encouraged him to grant me my request. With a very negative attitude he sent me a email with the hotel name of which was the Motel 6. After I left I looked it up on the internet and discovered it was in a very sketchy part of town.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"As a Delta Sky Miles member, #__________, we found the lack of communication and care for customers as insensitive, uncaring, and arrogant on the part of Delta and its staff.

My wife and I planned a trip from Boston to Amsterdam for July 16, 2023. Our record locator number was XXXXXXX.

Flight 256 was scheduled to depart at 5:15 pm on July 16, 2023 and arrive in Amsterdam at 6:15 am on July 17, 2023 (see attached).

We arrived at Logan Airport around 2:00 pm on July 16, 2023, more than three hours prior to Flight 256's scheduled departure time.

Our flight was delayed without explanation from the original  5:15 pm departure seven times as follows:

			7:00 pm
			8:15 pm
			9:30 pm
			11:00 pm
			11:30 pm
			12:00 am
			2:00 am 

During this time we sat waiting at the airport without any explanation for the delay.

The flight was cancelled at 2:00 am on July 17, 2023.

As a result of the unexplained cancellation, we missed the departure date and time for our cruise, and the associated first full day of sailing, meals and lodging on board our ship.

Subsequent to Flight 256's scheduled departure time on July 16, we expended unnecessary money on coffee and yogurt at the airport, were forced to hire an Uber to transport us from the airport to a place of lodging, had to arrange for a transportation from our place of lodging to the airport the following day, had to spend money on breakfast and lunch the following day prior to being placed on the same flight the following day, July 17, 2023.

Here is an itemized list of our expenses (for which we have receipts) incurred after 5:15 pm on July 16, 2023 up and until our rescheduled 5:15 pm Flight 256 on July 17, 2023:

coffee at airport				3.99
coffee at airport				3.99
yogurt at airport				5.08
pizza at airport			           18.46
coffee at airport				4.28
breakfast following day		           22.00
Uber from Logan at 2:00 am	           76.13

total				         133.93	

In addition, it was necessary to secure lodging at 2:00 am on July 17, 2023, as well as a ride to Logan on the afternoon of July 17, 2023. The value of this lodging and transportation is approximately $330.00; $255.00 for lodging and $75.00 for transportation.				

Not once during this experience did Delta or its employees offer even the slightest assistance. Rebooking for the following day's flight was arranged by our cruising company's emergency services line.

You should also be aware that after waiting at the airport for approximately twelve hours, we boarded the plane only to be told there was an issue, and that we needed to deplane. Really? Twelve hours following scheduled departure, and the plane STILL wasn't airworthy, and no one knew that until the plane had been boarded?

Just so you know, on our return flight 9517 from Zurich to Boston, our baggage was lost.

I had a flight from Dallas to New York to Prague, then back to Dallas for myself and my wife.
My 1st flight from DFW to JFK went well, no issues and very pleasant (flight Delta 534) … the issues started on the 2nd leg of the flight, from JFK to Prague (Delta 78). 1st of all, the legroom was less than our domestic flight. Made our 9 hours very uncomfortable. The TV screen kept locking up…. on a 9-hour flight, this was a big deal. The most important thing of all that happened was, during takeoff, there was a loud noise, fire, and black smoke from the engine. I thought to myself, I’m sure the flight team has noticed this and will do a go around and land, but nope, they just kept going, 15-20 minutes later, I got up and spoke to the flight crew and let them know there was fire and smoke out of the right engine for a good 2-3 seconds. They went to talk to the pilots, and we went back to JFK. They found a major issue with the engine and after a 3 hour wait in JFK, put us on another plane to Prague (same tiny amount of legroom and unresponsive entertainment screen). 
So, I potentially saved the lives of 300 or so people and millions of dollars for Delta, and I got a thank you and a sneak peak into the cockpit for the pilots to say thank you and I had a nice little chat with them. I mean, honestly if the rest of the flights and trip went well, I wasn’t even going to complain about this… but of course, issue after issue. 
No for the flights back. From Prague to JFK (Delta 79). For my return flights, I was on Delta one from Prague to JFK, and 1st class from JFK to Dallas.
There were some people asking very invasive questions about what I was doing in Prague, what kind of work I did, what does your position do, how many employees do you have, etc…. just kept going. At some point I said enough is enough and that this is borderline harassment. I will answer to US customs. They put a red sticker on my password and highlighted my boarding pass, so security pretty much emptied ALL of my bags and I had to repack it all. Seemed like retaliation for not answering questions about my life story to a stranger with no authority. The flight from Prague to JFK went fairly well, I guess. I was expecting more from Delta One, but a fellow passenger said: “it’s normally much better than this, and this is a very old plane and not nearly as good as it should be”. whatever, was still fine. We got to New York after a 3-4 hour delay due to landing at another airport (Stewart) to refuel because JFK wouldn’t allow us to land due to a storm. This particular part was not Delta’s fault. 
Thankfully, my flight from JFK to DFW (Delta 345) also kept getting delayed, so I thought I would make the flight. But of course not, why would it go well… lol. Delta completely cancelled that flight due to Maintenance issues. They rebooked me for a flight nearly 24 hours later because there were a lot of cancellations and rebooked flights. They gave me a hotel, and meal vouchers. Hotel was fine. But the meal vouchers would only work at the hotel, or the ORIGINAL airport that gave them to me…. But guess what? They rebooked me on a flight from LaGuardia to Atlanta, then Atlanta to Dallas. So, I couldn’t use the 45$ meal voucher, because the hotel’s restaurant was closed, and they wouldn’t accept it at La Guardia. This rebooking caused me to miss a full day of work, with so far, no compensation from Delta or partial refund on my ticket. Finally, the next day comes, and I go to La Guardia to head to Atlanta.

This leg went fine, got on the plane (Delta 545) and got to Atlanta. Now here’s the next nightmare. From Atlanta to Dallas, we all boarded the plane, thinking we’re about to take off and head home. But of course not, why would this go without event. The gate agent comes into the plane saying, “Sorry all, we need everyone to deboard the plane. They are going to put ya’ll on another plane”. I asked him why the hell are they doing this? he says “there are too few people for this size plane and they wanna put us on a smaller plane”… I was fuming at this point, thinking who the hell was a moron who made this decision…. So, we get off the plane, and they send to a whole other concourse. From concourse D to C. We get there and are waiting for multiple more hours. I got to talk to the pilot, and he said the gate agent was plain WRONG and it was because of another maintenance issue…. Jesus Delta! Cmon…. How old are these damn planes?! I was a little less angry at the reason now though. So, after 2-3 hours of waiting AGAIN, we finally got on the plane and headed back to Dallas. But instead of landing at 9:30 like originally planned, we landed at 1:30am…. My wife and kids were just sitting there waiting.  
I put in a refund claim to delta for the meal voucher and the day of work lost. So far, no reply. At this point, if I can help it, I will avoid Delta like I do Spirit. The flying part of my vacation was hell…

My question to Delta, don’t you pack snacks and drinks based on how many passengers are in the flight? Shortage of few can be understanding but completely one class got missed is ridiculous.

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"20th April 2023, I boarded Delta Airlines DL63 departing 2:10pm from London Gatwick, seated at a Delta comfort plus zone, Meal was served, I took a few spoonful and realised that the food had a gummy taste and texture to it. Though the meal was piping hot, not enough to disguise that the food had gone bad.
On arrival at JFK, I had the feeling to use the rest room.as it was quite urgent. The journey to where I was staying should have taken an hour, it took almost two hours because of the nausea and vomiting I experienced and frequent need to use the restroom. The food had given me the runs. What if I had eaten the whole meal?
I sent Delta the video of the food and I received a reply from Gautam Sachdeva (Air France KLM Customer Care Assistant ) stating ""I am sorry to learn about the discomfort you experienced as the quality of the meals provided was not good hence you are not feeling good"".
I spent the first day of my 10days trip in bed, losing a day of a planned break.
I believed the airline's food should have been produced with reasonable care, of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose.
In addition, the return flight DL62 was suppose to depart at 11:35pm on the 30th April from JFK, but was delayed almost 4 hours. A meal voucher was sent after all the eatery shops in the airport had closed. Even the Delta sky express lounge had closed for the night.

I already had a flight from Itami (on JAL) into Tokyo in the morning which led to a very uncomfortable 6 hour layover.  When arriving in Tokyo, the process of trying to fix the mess they created from the delayed flight was awful. The line to be helped by an agent was extremely long at which none of the agents tried to help and quicken the pace. There was a few agents walking around “helping” people towards the back of the line and they were very difficult to work with. They expressed passive aggressive behavior toward me and many other passengers trying to be helped. The 9-10 hour flight was as expected but the food was god awful and my in flight entertainment screen broke about 3 hours in. Furthermore, for such a long flight you’d expect the plane to be equipped with decently comfy seats, wrong. The upright positions were just forward enough that it felt like you were leaning forward and when reclined, the seats had almost no angle to lean back. The foot rests are terrible, mine and my partners were broken. After landing in Seattle I was rebooked a 5th time which led to another 5 hour layover.

We cancelled the flight when we found another flight leaving at 2:00.

My flight was delayed, and we were told at the terminal that it would be ""at least an hour,"" and that it would probably be longer. I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. 

Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be ""at least"" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone.

Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed.

So essentially, because of one communication on their end, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine. I understand that these things happen and it is complicated. I reached out in a professional way to Delta, and they emailed me apologizing and saying they would add 3,000 miles to my SkyMiles account. Turns out that 3,000 miles are worth about $30. I have seen overbooked Delta flights offer people credit cards for $500 or more, just like that.

I lost so much time and money with this experience, and I was honestly offended they'd think that $30 is an appropriate offer for a mistake like this. I asked if I could talk to someone else, remaining friendly with the individual since I know it's a company policy and customer service staff are not to blame. 

The email I got back said, ""Thank you for writing us back. I've utilized all my resources and have been advice by my leadership team that no further compensation can be issued. Regrettably we're unable to honor your request. We realize this is a disappointment, and trust you understand our position. We do appreciate your persistence but we will have to agree that we cannot find the right solution this time. Any further communication would not be productive and we will not respond again regarding this incident. We hope in time we'll have the opportunity to restore your confidence in our service. Take care and have a wonderful day!""

""We will not respond again regarding this incident"" ?

Delta has completely lost its once-great customer service and has gone downhill with mileage benefits, cost, seating options, and the whole experience.

First flight on Delta delayed by 2 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. Delta staff in New York gave me a hard time trying to get on a standby flight because they said my carry on bag had been checked and couldn't have me travel without it despite being the same destination. They didn't realize that my carry on was actually scheduled to be on the connecting standby flight. I had to point it out to them and then, they added me to the standby list. Also, they assured that if I didn't make the flight, then my bag would be moved to the current flight. I didn't make the standby flight but my checked carry still went with it despite their assurances. I found it at Montreal against a wall near a random carousal. 

Then my return flight got delayed. The delta employee told me to reschedule my connecting flight for a later one so I did that using the app on my phone. I asked him if I could be placed on standby list or be double booked for the original flight just in case it was delayed too. They said no because it won't be delayed. I arrived in New York and my original flight hadn't left yet because it was delayed. There were spots open and they were still boarding passengers. I asked to be added back to my original flight. But both the employee and supervisor Jacqueline wouldn't add me to the flight. Now I get to arrive home late at night with work in the AM.   

Overall, Delta's flight delays and poor customer service ruined my trip.

Not only did they not help all that much getting the flight rebooked, they also claimed that they ""don't provide hotels for bad weather"" so me and my husband had to pay for our own hotel for the night. However, another couple that was on our same trip and the same flight that got delayed and also missed the connecting flight not only got their hotel paid for, but also provided a taxi to and from the airport. I have no idea why me and my husband were treated so differently than this other couple but it is absolutely disgusting. After that we had numerous other issues pop up as the rebooked flight included 2 layovers and every time we needed help the staff was rude and condescending. Finally, when it was time for our connecting international flight, there was another issue and the staff was once again not helpful and we stood in line to be helped and we were flat-out ignored while multiple other customers were helped. We did not get helped until an older lady behind us stood up for us and demanded that we be helped. Then to top it off, when we finally landed one of our bags was delayed, and even though we were abroad for 17 days, the bag never made it to us and just kept going from airport to airport but never making it to our hotel, and on top of that, I filed a claim for reimbursement for 17 days worth of clothes, the hotel, and the ubers we had to take to get the clothes and I still haven't heard back on our reimbursement claim even though it has been over a month. I will never ever fly with this company again because the awful treatment me and my husband received was beyond disgusting and I can only think that we were treated so differently than this other couple either because we are much younger and so they were treating us as not a priority because we are college students or because me and my husband are an interracial couple.

Turns out if you are flying domestic and do not have your card on you, you do not get lounge access. Ok, no big deal, except the women in the lounge decided to take it upon herself to extremely rudely tell me I cannot enter and continued to aggressively respond to my questions and she began to sush me which was ridiculously inappropriate! Next I boarded the flight, first class, and the flight attendant warned me I would need to check my bag. As my suitcase is a verified carry on I was somewhat confused so I asked if there was a way to just bring it on board with me to which she responded “I am sure, we can fly tomorrow or today” telling me I was holding up the line. When boarding the plane I asked the other flight attendant if I could try to fit my luggage as I was in first class and not many people had bags on the flight. Of course my suitcase fit perfectly. The other flight attendant was not happy about this!! She called after me as I boarded the plane to stop me from brining my suitcase on. And many other passengers were complaining about her amount of attitude. (The flight attendants name was Barbra). I am extremely upset and displeased with the customer service I have experienced at delta today.

Once at the hotel I had to get on delta chat/text to ask about a meal voucher since we weren’t given one at the airport.  I noticed at 1:30 am they texted me a link to one.

It would have been nice to have an apology from your flight crew for their behavior towards me during and after my return flight. I arrived at MJB for my return home feeling a bit fatigued not realizing I was sick until making it to the gate. Twice before boarding, I had to leave my seat to visit the nearest trash can to vomit. Now, feeling a bit sick and weak I’m struggling to make it to the plane aside my wife. Once seated an attendant went from suggesting the captain's concern to it being a passenger. She asks was I ok, I told her that I was feeling super tired and that was the extent of anything I could explain to her about my condition only for her to suggest that I was inebriated or on some sort of drugs. I assured her that I was not and as well I did not understand what evidence she had to support her theory and be so short and unconcerned for me. In addition, I expressed to her there would be no issue from my seat as there was not the entire flight. Once in flight, the most I could muster was to lay my head against my wife’s shoulder and pray somehow sleep was what I needed although my condition was much worst than I thought. I spent the whole flight vomiting in bags provided to my wife and was conscious of not disturbing other passengers much. We were forced to carry those bags off the plane which I couldn’t understand knowing a crew would be disposing of any trash. I quickly found out why. Once landing I had only one attendant that appeared to wish me to feel better, and once arriving at the gate after that 2-hour flight, I was greeted by a drug-sniffing dog and an officer who was signaled by your attendant to address my bags and not the medical attention that I needed after they observed me during the flight. I imagine their disappointment when I was not arrested. I was humiliated and disgusted that I was treated this way. For whatever reason there was a biased approach toward me and my well-being. I am so disappointed in your airline when I chose before to not consider any other . I intend to make aware of this situation to anyone that would listen. Though I haven’t decided on any future travel with the airline. This experience makes me reconsider after such stellar travel experiences before. My greatest disappointment is after the interaction with the officers still, no attendant apologized nor acknowledged me any further. This has strongly hurt my faith in what I felt was the best airline to travel and it’s important to add to your training of attendants a more comprehensive way of determining who is a threat and who needs attention. I don’t expect a reply from customer service but I’m willing to publish my experience if it can help with future experiences on any airline. BTW once in the terminal of ATL I received the medical attention I needed, that’s thanks to the great first responders stationed in the ATL airport.

On a business trip to Edinburgh, my first flight was delayed so there was only 20 minutes to transfer.   I made it on the flight, but my bags did not.   It happens.  I was not worried.

When I got to EDI, there was no Delta representative at baggage claim to report the lost bag.   Delta claims that the company SwissPort handles their bags.   So I reported to SwissPort.   Tje SwissPort attendant had me write my name, contact info, and baggage claim on a piece of paper.  The attendant took it, looked at it, and threw it in a big pile.  He said someone would input the request and email.   He had nothing else to say to me or the other passengers who lost their bag.  Swiss Port  would not give us a reference number for our claims.

I called Delta numerous times.   Delta said it was out of their hand and it was Swiss Port that would take care of my claim.  They told me to file a claim with Delta,  However, to file a claim with Delta, one needs a ""reference number"" from the attendant who the lost bag was reported to.   You see where I am going with this?  Delta washed their hands to the issue of the lost bag.  They basically contracted a company to shoo away customer claims.  Passengers are entirely powerless if Delta loses their baggage now.

More frustrating is that I found out by tracking my baggage claim number that Delta sent the bag to EDI the next day on another flight and it  made it to EDI.  

Unfortunately, Swiss Port, the company that Delta has contracted.  So the bag was locked up at EDI airport within my reach, but Swiss Port refused to attend to me or the other customers in the same situation.   I don't know the fate of the bag, but Delta says that they will keep it for 60 days.  

I, and others, have waited at the counter for hours to talk to a Swiss Port agent and have failed.  They don't answer their phones either.  When we try to go online to fill out Swiss Port's missing bag form, it says, ""sorry, Swiss Port does not deal with this airline carrier.""  Delta and Swiss Port are sending us in circles and pointing finger at each other. 

Lost bags happen.  Ultimately, it is Delta who is responsible for contracting a company which will attend to their customers and resolve these issues.   They have failed, and my trust in them is broken for business trips.","Delta Negligent of Proper Claims Process for Lost Bags","false","false"

We normally like Delta and for our round trip flight we selected Comfort Plus seats, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The issue for us started on our return trip to Dulles International (Washington DC - IAD). We got to the airport in Nassau in plenty of time for our flight (3 hours prior), our flight was scheduled to depart just after 1 pm. While waiting there was an announcement that the flight was delayed due to a maintenance issue. Turns out a tire needed to be replaced and there wasn't the right spare in the Bahamas, so one was going to have to be flown in from the states. Once the initial announcement was made, there were no follow up announcements from the Delta boarding counter. After two hours without an update, I went to the counter to ask one of the gate agents if they could provide an update on the status of the flight, which they said they would but never did. The Delta app was giving incorrect information constantly, at one point it said there was another plane inbound but when I asked the gate agent they said that was incorrect and we would be flying out on the same flight with the maintenance issue. We ended up waiting until around 6 pm before the flight left Nassau, so we spent around 8 hours waiting for our flight and ended up missing our connection out of Atlanta. Delta did provide us with a meal voucher at the hotel and both a meal and hotel voucher in Atlanta and awarded us 5000 Skymiles. Delta guaranteed us seats on a flight the next day but couldn't give us our seat assignments until we got to the gate, which is kind of ridiculous. We checked with their Customer Service desk and were told we could only get our seat assignments at the gate. My 9 yr old and my wife were concerned we would not be able to sit together, Delta was able to get us seats together in the second to the last row on the aircraft, which was a B717 with the engines mounted on the tail of the aircraft, so we were basically sitting right next to the engines, which were loud for the entire trip back to DC. Keep in mind we paid for Comfort Plus seats for all our flights but due to Delta's ineptitude with this flight we ended up losing our Comfort Plus seats that we had paid for.  We were told we will be reimbursed for the cost of Comfort Plus, but I haven't seen anything yet. The lack of updates at the airport in Nassau and the incorrect information on the Delta app is in direct violation of Delta's own Customer Service policy. Because of this whole debacle and missing our connection, both my wife and I had to take an extra day of leave from work. Again, we typically like Delta, but the last two return flights coming back to Dulles with them have been horrendous. On a previous flight our tickets and seats were cancelled at the gate just as we were getting ready to board without any explanation from the gate agents, we were simply told to stand aside as they boarded other passengers. Come to find out after they had boarded the plane, and given our seats away to stand-by passengers, that our connecting flight had been cancelled and so they cancelled our initial flight out of Ft. Lauderdale. The gate agents were rude and unhelpful and wanted us to wait 24 hours for another flight. We finally got them to put us on the same flight we were originally supposed to be on, but no longer sitting together, with a connecting flight to Reagan International, where we had to take a cab back to Dulles to retrieve our vehicle.  Even though we were given 5k miles, hotel and meal vouchers as a result of the maintenance issues associated with our most recent trip, it didn't make up for the work lost or the time wasted sitting at the airport.

After a few hours of waiting we were finally told that the flight is being cancelled. They gave us all a $15 voucher for food (which by the way couldnt even buy you a full meal at the airport Subway), a flight for the next morning and a promise to pay for a hotel room. Took forever to get the food voucher and my bags back. Once I got to the hotel that they were gonna pay for, I found out that there were no rooms available for anyone on the plane! I get back to the airport and at this point only had about six hours before the supposed next flight i was booked for. I decided to try and rest at the airport. 

Time for the next flight. Not really! This one was delayed as well because we were waiting on the co-pilot! So now we are delayed an hour waiting on the co-pilot to drive from Ft Lauderdale to Miami.

But things went downhlll fast once we landed at Jacksonville.
The Delta app assured me that the wheelchair I had ruquested would be waiting.
It was. The problem was, their was no attendant. So we sat for about 15 minutes, me in the wheelchair, two 70ish women in the same fix,  my wife standing with my walker.
Finally a man showed up. His solution was to put the walker in my lap, have my 82-year-old wife push me while he pushed the two women.
Along the way he loaded by luggage on a cart (thankfuly the women had no luggage.
Surely, I thought, he would call for retinforcements, No, he wrestled two wheelchairs and a luggage cart to the parking shuttle pickup area by himself.
A heroic effort. But it took 40 minutes -- 40 minutes with that walker in my lap.
Once at the shuttle stop, he pocketed  tip and left us there.
This was in such sharp contrast the service we received from American Airlines on the outbound leg of trip.
When we landed at Vancouver, the wheelchair was waiting. So was not one attendant, not two, but three.
One pushed me, one pushed my walker, and off we went to baggage claim where the third collected my luggage and loaded it on a cart (carts were plentiful,  and free.

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"The Class of Service list did not include the category in which we flew. It was actually Delta's new Premium Select and as much as I like Delta and rarely find fault with the airline, Premium Select was a huge disappointment. We flew the trans-Atlantic legs (Minneapolis-Amsterdam, Amsterdam-Seattle) of our trip from Vancouver to Athens on an Airbus A333 aircraft. The cabin looked good when we entered and we were warmly greeted by an ace cabin crew and provided with a blanket, pillow, and amenities kit. All very nice, but where do you put the pillow and blanket when you aren't using them —on your lap or on the floor (there was no room above)? Yes, there's more legroom than in economy or Comfort +, but not much more. Depending on your height, you may not find the seat very comfortable. (Frankly, the economy seats on our 45-minute shuttle flight from Seattle to Vancouver on our way home were much more comfortable.) The person in front of you can still fully recline (as the person in front of me did) which encroaches on your space, puts the entertainment screen in the seatback on your nose, and tilts the seat so that you have to crane your neck to watch the screen that's on your nose. Neckache, anyone? The lighting is also iffy: flying at night the cabin lights are turned off and individual lights for reading are not very strong; dim to be honest. It's as though Delta is saying ""You must sleep!"" And the food. Ah, yes, the food. Delta promotes a finer dining experience in Premium Select. Maybe, but not on our flights. I think the food was the same as what Comfort + gets, we just had nicer plates and utensils. But the gloppy dinner choices stunk up the cabin. Some would use the word ""aromatic"" to describe the garlic and onion aromas wafting through the cabin from our meal; I would use the word ""odors."" And breakfast? An egg McMuffin equivalent. Seriously? Bottom line: I think Delta is trying hard to offer more, but it has a long, long way to go in Premium Select to match similar Air France or KLM cabins across the water. Premium Select sits between Comfort + and Business Class on Delta and costs significantly more than Comfort +.  It's just not worth it. Next time we'll go Comfort + and use the money we save on other parts of our trip.

I do not believe Delta properly maintains their aircraft. Every single time I’ve flown with them there’s always been a maintenance delay. This time however, they delayed the flight all day leaving their passengers in the airport for over 12 hours, no apology, no available staff, and $15 so we didn’t starve. After lying to everyone all day about when the flight was going to leave, saying the problem was solved and the crew was on the way, they cancelled it. Additionally, somehow Delta managed to loose my bag that never made it on the plane, and never left the airport. If I didn’t have an airtag in it I don’t believe I would’ve gotten it back. I had to sit there in the baggage office on the phone to someone upstairs explaining where they put my bag.

Absolutely all flights were delayed. I had the following flight: Romania-Paris-Boston-Charleston.
The plane ""Romania - Paris"" was delayed by an hour, I had a layover in Paris to Boston for an hour and 10 minutes, logically, the plane left without me and 10 others who were in the same situation.
After the company apologized ..... And they changed our tickets, now I have to fly to New York and then to Charleston. Those in Paris made another reservation for me, but they were not able to complete it. I arrived in New York, and the people there were not able to check me in after the ticket that the people in Paris gave me, they simply made me another ticket with a different time and didn't even tell me they said, I was ready because I had 30 minutes left and I didn't notice that they changed my flight completely.
those from Paris made me a ticket with the time 1:15 PM, and those from New York with the time 5:45 PM. (The people from New York are rude, they didn't give me any explanation)
when I got to the plane and presented the ticket, then I found out that I actually had another flight.
Anyway, this flight was delayed by an hour, it didn't matter that I was very disappointed by this experience anyway.
I finally arrived in Charleston, where I found out that my luggage was in Atlanta.

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"On both flights coming into Norway from Amsterdam and leaving Norway flying into Amsterdam, the KLM Cityhopper plane would not start. Flying into Norway from Amsterdam at the Amsterdam Airport, the plane had computer issues, so we had to sit in a hot plane and eventually get on a bus to be transported to a plane that would actually work. This caused a flight delay, but was not catastrophic because Bergen, Norway was our final destination. On the return KLM CityHopper flight in Amsterdam, the engine would not start due to an issue with the power; thus, we waited in a hot cabin for 2 hours before technicians finally got the plane in operable condition.  Unfortunately, we missed our connecting Delta flight in Amsterdam back into the United States and either had to wait until the next day for a Delta flight or accept a downgrade from Comfort+ to Economy on another KLM plane. This is not what we paid for. Our family was separated into different sections of the plane. Seriously disappointed in DELTA because KLM Cityhopper is their European Partner airline. KLM needs to invest in planes that actually work the first time. Twice in a row we endured hot cabin conditions, a plane with dysfunctional engines, and lastly, being diverted onto an airline that we did not originally book with, and being serparated from my family if we wanted to get to our final destination on time.

I have traveled on Delta many times before and loved it. On May 4/2023 I traveled on Delta going to St. Lucia W.I. and it was a comfortable trip. I paid for extra legroom round trip. The Flight Attendant was nice and served us well. Most importantly I received a wheelchair that I had requested round trip. On May 21/2023 I traveled back to America and the flight was unbearable. At the airport, I forgot to buy a bottle of water to take my medications. The Flight Attendant was not helpful at all. She offered half a cup of water for the whole 4 hours flight, and I could not take my medications. I was hurting all through the flight. When I left the plane there was no one with the wheelchair that I had requested. Walking a few distances, asked a Delta employee who told me that she has no access to call for a wheelchair, the second employee told me the wheelchair workers have left for the day, and the third person told me to go back to where the sign said wheelchair. I finally told the immigration that I requested a wheelchair, and he told the person at the desk to call for one, but no one came. after I finished with TSA she called twice for a wheelchair and still they did not show. Until I walked again, and the next person called for a wheelchair. It took them half hour to come and get me to the plane and my flight was already leaving. This was the worst experience since I traveled on Delta. I am very disappointed and do not know if I can do it anymore.

Once I boarded and prior to take off a young lady (mid 30's)  approached me and said she was seated in First Class and had heard about my experience.  She offered to trade seats with me as the person next to me in 19A was a friend. I was surprised and asked if she was trying to give me a heart attack. She hugged me and assured me she wanted to exchange her First Class seat for my seat. I did and could not believe it.  You see I was traveling to attend my .94 year old aunt's funeral . The passenger sitting next to me in First Class was exceptionally nice and asked me several times if I was okay, did I need to get up for the bathroom. If I had enough food, etc. God's Angels were watching over me that day and I appreciate everything. I even looked for the lady after I got off the plane and at Baggages Claim.

During such an instance on the weekend of May 19th, I was incredibly fortunate to be assisted by Steve Parker, a remarkable representative of Delta Airlines.

From the onset, Steve's patient demeanor and genuine concern were as soothing as a soft landing. He stayed on the line with me, displaying a degree of empathy and understanding that is so often absent in the hurried world of travel. His commitment to customer satisfaction was more than evident - it was truly exceptional.

At one point, I had to disconnect our call but Steve assured me that he would be there when I needed him. True to his word, he was available for a callback, further underlining his impressive dedication to service. It's one thing to offer help, but to ensure availability across multiple interactions shows an exemplary level of professionalism and care.

Steve's tireless efforts to mitigate my travel troubles transformed a potential headache into a pleasant experience. His dedication to easing my concerns made a world of difference. My travel plans may have changed, but thanks to Steve, my faith in Delta's commitment to its customers has never been stronger. Especially after I'd been hung up on by a different representative.

Steve Parker went above and beyond with his customer service, which is a testament to the airline's reputation. His efforts made my experience not just easier, but truly enjoyable.

The agent AGREED in writing, and assured us that Delta would refund us for the difference of the two trips, considering it was over $1,000.00 to book this second flight. Again, we were weary that Delta would refund it, so we asked repeatedly and he, over and over again, reassured us that Delta would refund us and even gave us the amount in which they would. 
He told us how to submit the claim for the refund, which we did & after weeks of no response, Delta went back on their word and is not refunding us. Not only, are they not standing by their word, the customer service experience was terrible, ending with the agent stating this was their last response, the case is closed and any further response wont receive a reply.

Free alcohol as you'd expect but strangely completely different range on way out to way back. The IPA brewed specifically for Delta was really quite good. K1664 Blanc on the way out was lovely. 

Seats were nowhere near as comfy or roomy as you'd get in an Emirates / Qatar / Etihad plane for a similar length journey out to Dubai. Narrow armrests like on a short European flight and plastic seats so got very sweaty which was uncomfortable for sleeping. Got a bad back on the first flight as couldn't get right seat position.

Legroom was decent and in flight entertainment screen was a good size and resolution. Content was enough to pass a 6hr flight. 

Staff were friendly and helpful and during the flight there were snacks like Oat Bars, Biscoff and Sponge Cakes you could get from the galley. 

Toilets were clean and flights on time.

This is the first year I booked with Delta and I spent hours finding the best flights for our schedule. All of my flights that I have booked with Delta have had a significant change or changes that are not even comparable to the flights I have booked. The arrival times, departure times, the number of connecting flights, etc.  I have never had this significant of an issue with other airlines, jetblue, southwest, united. I thought this was common for smaller regional airlines but not expected from Delta.  I had to cancel one trip and lost out on expenses of activities pre-booked. Delta will refund the tickets but they can't refund the other expenses.  Why post flight times a few months in advance if they plan to just change them the month prior to departure? I don't know of a successful business model that offers a service that you pay for, and then right before said service they change the terms and tell you that you can accept it or get a refund.  My advice to all is DO NOT book with Delta until they stop doing this, even if you believe the flight itinerary looks better or is priced better, just know they will change it and make it worse.

The only absolute bummer about the flight, was that we hit some turbulence right away, as they were preparing to serve food & drinks.  They immediately put the cart away, before anyone was served, and that was the last we seen it. The flight was smooth after a few minutes of turbulence, with plenty of time after to serve us snacks & drinks. I believe the staff was overworked and exhausted and just didn't want to deal with it.

I purchased comfort plus tickets for our entire family to return home from spring break selecting seats for us to be able to sit together (because that is common sense when flying with minor children).

My 4 year old wasn’t even in comfort and didn’t even have a seat assigned. My husband was sitting somewhere else as well.  We asked the agent at the gate and he chose the seat that was available because he said there was nothing he could do. So,my kids were sitting away from us not in comfort. This should not have happened. This is negligence and so unsafe. We were not on standby, we bought confirmed comfort seats like we always.

My husband had spent 3 months planning this flight with our German shepherd where we had also confirmed 4 separate times with 4 separate employees that his size, weight and kennel size could fly. We chose a specific and less desired flight plan to ensure the plane was large enough to hold him per their regulations with the help from Deltas reservation employees. We were also quoted a fee of $250 for him to fly and booked. The day we landed in BWI we went to check in and the lady (she said she was a ""red Vest"") at the check in counter told us we were lying and that he was too big and could only fly for over 4k$ on a cargo only plane. After us further explaining the situation and how many times we verified he could fly on this flight she called the reservations desk to ask if they are telling families they can fly on a regular plane with my size of kennel and they even confirmed yes to her. She then yelled at them for always doing this and leaving her to deal with it. She then said this is happening all of the time to active duty military members flying on official PCS orders.

I was living in the UK when I had my vaccines so my current certificate is the only evidence i have 3.

The ground crew were tremendously unhelpful and told me that I wasn't getting the flight.  This was a saturday and I was told I would just have to ""get a hotel and wait until Monday when the NHS was available"".

But refused to give us any first aid kit, or offered even a tissue or gauze that we had requested for more than 15 minutes. The surgeon next to me requested the first aid kit as well.

Tone of voice and selection of words used by Delta Flight Attendants has nothing to do with custmer service and their open rudness towards economy passengers shall be addressed by those who train and conduct audits.  
Upon take off and 3 times requesting to provide headset an announcement has been made there are no headsets for all passengers. 9 hrs flight and not a single movie could have been watched. Apparently this is a standard on Delta flights were only certain % of headsets are loaded. Cabin Crew confirmed Delta expects passengers to bring their own headphones. I had my apple headset with me.

Upon short walk within the cabin we noticed few people were using their own headphones and so they were kind enough to share their Delta headsets with us.

After a half-hour walk from Terminal A to Terminal B, we finally boarded our flight only to have it terminated after 1.5 hours on the tarmac, due to engine failure.  The announcement was made that our replacement flight was at the beginning of Terminal A and would be leaving in a half hour. My husband has Parkinson's and simply cannot walk fast.  We both had carry-on luggage and as we tried to hurry, we realized that it would be hopeless to get there on time.  We stood to the side to see what we could do, when the flight crew from our failed plane approached us.  I asked if they were the crew on our flight and when they confirmed that they were, the Captain, John Riffle, asked how he could help us get to the next plane.  As soon as I explained our dilemma, he immediately leapt into action, had a wheelchair crew come over to us in minutes, and the head of the wheelchair service summoned her fastest aide to get my husband to the Gate while I literally ran all the way there.  Captain Riffle asked that I stop by the cockpit on our way into the second plane to let him know that we had made it onboard.  He promised that he wouldn't leave without us.  The kindness of this man erased all of the frustration and anxiety that I felt that travel day.  It is hard enough when one travels alone, but when there is a companion with special needs, it can be a nightmare when things go wrong.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"This is a copy of the letter I wrote to ITA and DELTA airlines a month ago, and I have received no aid since. 

On March 12, I flew from LGA to BOS with Delta and then transferred to ITA to finish my journey to FCO. All of this was booked through Delta. I am a twenty year old college student traveling internationally with one other friend for the first time, so I was taking every precaution and purposefully packed everything I needed in a carry-on to avoid luggage complications. Upon arrival in LGA, Delta suddenly forced me to check my carry-on. I pleaded with them to let me keep it with me as I had a connecting flight with ITA less than an hour after the first flight would arrive. I explained that I was alone and worried about not having the important items with me. In the frenzy of the moment and dismissive employees urging me to board the plane, I was not able to clearly think about all items in my bag that I physically could not go without. Everything I said was completely disregarded, and every employee I spoke with was dismissive and rude. They promised me my bag would make it to Rome. 

When I arrived at the ITA gate in BOS, I stood in line to talk to the crew about making sure this transfer of luggage had taken place. They barely acknowledged my request, saying luggage would be transferred, and told me to board the plane. I once again waited in line and asked them to check and they refused to, growing frustrated and rude with me, so I boarded the plane. Upon arrival in Rome, my friend that I was traveling with was detained and sent back to The United States due to a passport issue, leaving me alone in Italy. Neither of our bags showed up in Rome, further complicating the issue as I stood alone in the Rome airport panicking on what I was going to do.

This was Monday morning. I was not able to get my bag until Friday afternoon. 

Because I packed everything in a carry-on that I expected to have with me at all times, I put all of my medication, glasses, and contacts in that bag. I have terrible vision, so if something happened to the pair of contacts that I had in, I would have been completely blind. Also, I went without my antidepressants and hormonal birth control for five days and suffered from side effects that hindered me from enjoying those first five days in the slightest. One of the days I was so ill that I was unable to leave my hotel. Not only was this inconvenient, but also incredibly dangerous as I was left mentally unstable and physically ill in a foreign country, alone. I take Wellbutrin and Lexapro for anxiety and depression. Neither of which is ever safe to suddenly forego using. I already suffer from hormone imbalances, which is why I am on birth control in the first place, so now my condition is worsened and will take months to resolve. 

 My symptoms from not taking Lexapro and Wellburtrin included nausea, brain tremors, dizziness, confusion, suicidal thoughts, severe emotional fluctuations, headache, fever, and disorientation from brain fog. In summary, I was miserable.

In addition to this, all of my clothes were lost to where I had nothing to wear. I washed my underwear in the sink every night and wore the same workout set and light sweater everyday. I had to cancel my boat excursion because I did not have warm clothing to go out onto the water, and I was not able to find clothing in Amalfi or Positano suitable for the weather. Any clothing items sold in the tourist towns is thin and linen. On both of these trips, I opted to take a car from Scala, where I was staying, as I felt that my current unmedicated state (nauseous, dizzy, and disoriented) would prevent me from arriving at my destination safely by other means. 

My hotel was in limited communication with ITA, and was able to find out that my luggage would arrive Friday afternoon. I was scheduled to take a train to Rome Friday morning, so we had to coordinate a way for a driver to take me to the lost and found location in Naples. This was also an expensive trip. 

I am a twenty-year-old college student and have been saving up for this trip for my entire life. As you can imagine, I am incredibly upset with how it turned out due to your company’s carelessness in providing the service that I paid for when booking my flight. 
 
I am frustrated with Delta for the lack of attention to something like this and utter disregard for the concerns that I clearly expressed to employees. I am not sure where the disconnect between Delta and ITA was, but it resulted in a substantial waste of money.","Worst week of my life","false","false"

We live in Concord, NC, which is half an hour away from Charlotte International Airport. Delta offered nonstop flights, but it was out of Raleigh, NC, which is 2 hours away from us. We booked the flight for Thursday, March 30, 2023 leaving at 7:15am. We decided to rent a hotel room the night before and park my car at a hotel that offered airport shuttle service. We did online check-in that afternoon and the website said our flight was still on schedule. Upon checking in to our hotel, we received messages that Delta had cancelled our flight and we were being rebooked by them. I was to catch a flight from Raleigh to Atlanta with a layover and then to Seattle. My daughter and her husband were booked on a flight with a layover in New York. This was unacceptable. I am disabled and need assistance. We called Delta and was on hold for over an hour before we spoke to an agent. He informed us there was no information on the cancelled flight and would try to find a flight we could travel together. There were no nonstop flights and we would have to do a layover. We could have left from Charlotte or driven to Atlanta so we wouldn’t have to do a layover. He finally found a flight leaving from Greensboro, NC, that would accommodate all three of us with a layover in Atlanta. I was told because I was making a voluntary rebooking, I would not be credited for the difference in price. We booked the flight, because we had no other choice and this meant driving from Raleigh to Greensboro, an hour away. We were not able to be seated together as the plane was fully booked. I have filed a complaint and was informed that it could take up to 30 days for a review. Upon arrival in Atlanta, my daughter checked the flights leaving from Raleigh and all flights from Raleigh to Seattle were cancelled, no matter what city the layover was in. Thank goodness we left from Greensboro or we may have been delayed a whole day. Caught Alaska airlines on return flight. Had to rent a car in Raleigh and then drive to Greensboro to pick up my car.

Because I am on a budget, I could not fly first class both ways, so only opted for the first class on the way home.  First of all, let me say I clearly understand that this is as low on the scale of problems as one can go, given the world situation, however, I still want folks to know that based on my recent experience with Delta Airlines' First Class, I will never (ever) fly first class again - with any airlines - even if I could afford it.  The stewardess in charge of First Class on this flight was incredibly rude, and seemed confused.  We were served nothing to eat or drink for nearly 1.5 hours into the flight (and only after Main Cabin was served), and when asked, the rude stewardess said she had paperwork to complete.  The goal was to sleep part of the way, which was impossible, because they were so late serving dinner. Delta has mis-stepped recently in the past, so we're exploring other airlines, but paying extra for First Class with Delta, is genuinely a waste of money (and because I had booked so early, it was fortunately only a modest amount extra).  Plus, the people themselves in First Class are not very nice (that isn't Delta's fault, but the rest of the miserable experience in First Class was Delta's fault).

Someone I had met on this trip paid for me to get a 1st class flight since I couldn’t sit up for 9 hours after the surgery. This flight could have been a horrible experience but it was the exact opposite! The staff wheeled me in a wheel chair in between the layovers miles and miles. They were there checking on me most of the time and helped me any time I needed to get up. I had such a good experience with them in this vulnerable time that I decided I would fly Delta as much as I could. I even got a credit card through them. 

This experience was wonderful for a variety of reasons. The people that helped me were amazing and I felt very cared for. This was one of the most vulnerable experiences of my life and the stewardesses and various people that took care of me did wonderful. The airplanes are always very nice and clean which was positive physical evidence. Their professionalism was stellar and I really enjoyed my flight. I was in first class, so the food was phenomenal. Although, even in coach on the flight to Poland, the food was great! With their credit card, I have gotten so many miles for my efforts to use the credit card. That experience has also been great. I wouldn’t be surprised if the executives created a journey map because each touch point was a wonderful experience. It seems when we are most vulnerable, those that take care of us can be either aweful or awesome. Delta was awesome!","Grateful for Delta Airlines","false","false"

During this latest trip from New Orleans to Las Vegas on April 3, our first leg (New Orleans to Atlanta) was delayed by 40 minutes. I thought it would be nice to spend that 40 minutes in the SkyClub with my friend. I had a rude awakening. I was told that for this small amount of time, I would be admitted - of course - but my friend would only be admitted for a $50 fee. I expressed my surprise and displeasure. In return, the  attendant, who could have put Cerberus to shame was rude and totally uninterested. His attitude was ""Pal, take it or leave it. I don't really care who you are"". 
The well-known aphorism "" Treating every customer like the ONLY customer, everytime"" has been turned on its head here twice.

First by Delta who is treating its best and loyal customers like garbage, especially after being totally responsible for a delay. Second by having an attendant who shows no respect of appreciation for one of Delta's top customers.

This airline which is making huge profits is disrespecting its core customers at its SkyClub facilities and displaying a dismal sense of customer appreciation.

It is time that they get a clear signal that this type of behavior is unacceptable and must be addressed at the highest level","Delta Skyclubs: How to disrespect and antagonize your best and loyal customers","false","false"

I was a bit hesitant about Delta when I found out that if you don't pay for your seat, they are chosen by the airline and my husband and I might be separated - and on the last leg of our trip, we were not seated together.  The first leg, from Des Moines to Atlanta, I did find that it was SO loud, it was difficult to communicate with my husband and even the attendants.  We did leave a bit late and didn't have a lot of time to get to our connecting flight in Atlanta but I noticed on my Delta app that I could request wheelchair assistance for my husband, who walks with a cane.  The wheelchair was waiting for him as we exited the plane and got us to our connecting gate just in time for our flight.  The Airbus that took us from Atlanta to West Palm Beach was HEAVEN!  I didn't even feel the takeoff or landing, it was quiet, we had a myriad of choices for TV, movies and music and for basic economy, I had quite a bit of room!  Our return flight from West Palm Beach to Atlanta was also on an Airbus so again, wonderful flight.  There were severe storms in Atlanta that delayed our takeoff for over 30 minutes so again, I knew we had very little time to make our connection.  I again requested wheelchair access for my husband and with the expertise of the ""driver"" in knowing how to get around Atlanta quickly, she delivered us to our plane on time.  As I said, originally we were separated on the last leg but not only got seated together but also got bumped up to ""Comfort"" class.  This plane was much quieter than the first leg so a better flight and the attendants on all flights were top-notch!  We arrived back to Des Moines, but because of the quick connection, our luggage did not.  However, it was a quick claim process when we landed and our luggage was delivered to us that evening.

The original itinerary of the flight was Delta 4849, a 37 minute layover, and then flight 275.
Due to some unforeseen circumstances, Delta 4849 was delayed which cause me and my dad (HV7ETA) to miss flight 275. This delay caused our arrival time to be delayed by nearly a whole day. What was originally a 20 hour trip, turned into a 40+ hour trip which is frankly outrageous. 

Furthermore, I needed to talk to Delta staff several times to resolve the situation. I needed to talk to staff in DTW to reroute our flight through LAX, I needed to talk to staff at LAX in order to find hotel accommodations, and I needed to talk to staff in order to check into my flight from LAX to HND. Each time I needed to talk to staff I needed to wait a long time which only exacerbated how unpleasant the trip was. The staff were not proactive in trying to help me out, and it required a lot of work on my part. What was supposed to be a streamlined experience turned out to be very labor intensive and time consuming.

On top of the 20+ hour delay and the additional effort on my part, I also needed to shift/cancel my hotel stays, reduce my trip one day and pay for additional food at the airport I never intended to pay for (the meal vouchers we were given were not enough to cover our meals).

"Desktop","3","review","1",,"As a former Contributing Editor to Smithsonian Air & Space magazine, I've written a lot about air travel.  But now customer service and booking issues are becoming a global problem, with 20.6 percent of all flights delayed, according to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  The fallout from these delays hurts customers most.  Our Delta flights to and from London and Paris to New York and Charlotte are cases in point.

Twice enroute to London and back from Paris yesterday, we missed connections on Delta due to late start ups and air traffic issues. We were actually forced to sleep on the floor at JFK because we could not obtain a  Delta voucher for a hotel; the airline had only three agents trying to re-book hundreds of frustrated passengers standing on lines for hours at midnight...A Delta rep  I finally reached on a hotline reported to me an ""automatic"" re-booking to London on Virgin Atlantic the next day , 10 hours later. She also told me she could not issue any hotel voucher or compensation for a non-weather related screw up. When we landed from Charlotte at JFK, we were told to ""run"" to Delta flight 3 to London Heathrow located at a gate literally miles away.  The same instructions for a women traveling to Peru with three small children.  They ran and missed their flight.  We took the outdoor shuttle that snaked through runways; we were 10 minutes late and the aircraft would not wait.

It occurs to me that the airline is shooting itself in the foot by allowing  tens of thousands of passengers to book domestic to international flights without adequate time in between....not enough time to compensate for predictable delays    due to weather, tarmac or air traffic bottlenecks, redundant security screenings, fewer than optimal numbers of available trained agents, and pilots/crews not showing up on time.   We even found on the famous Delta ""app"" that we could not obtain boarding passes for our Paris flight home, nor for our re-booked Charlotte flight when we missed the connection.  The Delta check in system told us to access Air France instead.  While Air France is a Delta partner airline, its check in page   didn't recognize our reservation.  Our Paris to New York flight turned out to be a Delta flight exclusively -- Air France was not at all involved.

Travel has become brutal, expensive, and exhausting.  Federal law does not protect US consumers.  However, after making several calls to a Delta ""How can we help"" complaint line at 1-800 325-3732, I reached two representatives who, hearing that I was a journalist, at least provided future Delta vouchers for travel. [One supervisor who was supposed to ""escalate"" my case turned out to be rude and incredibly nasty. When  I told her our story, she blithely remarked,  ""Stop right there. We don't owe you anything.""  She added, ""We don't give out hotel vouchers"" (not true in many cases).  To my question about allowing passengers bookings with too short times in between t domestic and international connections, she replied. "" Our travel connection times are legal.""  No further explanation.

I believe this is not a Delta problem alone.  More than 1.3 million passengers in 2022 were delayed and otherwise inconvenienced.  Airline logistic systems and untrained representatives are a big part of the problem, as are redundant and incredibly stupid repeat security screen procedures.

I would argue that the entire system has to be seriously revised.  If you are contemplating international connections, leave hours -- at least three to four hours -- in between scheduled domestic arrival times at major airports.","Missed connections, sleeping at JFK, and remarkably bad passenger booking logistics","false","false"

So after months of planning, packing, and making arrangements we sit at home and have completely lost our seven day cruise!

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"In December 2022 I took a Delta flight from Austin to California and then the return flight back to Austin. On the return flight, my original seat was changed. That was not a huge deal as I really don't care where I sit. However, when it came time to get on the plane, my carry-on bag was taken from me by the check-in attendant and I was told that the seat that I was sitting in did not have an overhead compartment for my carry-on luggage. I attempted to explain to the check-in attendant that I needed my carry-on luggage to be with me, because we were not going straight to baggage claim when we landed, but instead meeting family in the airport for dinner, and I did not want my baggage to be on the turnstile  for an extended period of time or stolen. I was told by the check-in attendant that if I wanted my carry-on baggage to be with me, then I should have bought a more expensive plane ticket and that maybe I would pay more money next time and not have this issue. I was so stunned into silence at his classist remarks that I just let it go so that I could board my plane. This employee made the remark rather loudly, and I believe he intentionally publicly shamed me because they were having a rough day. There were several other guests of the airline around to hear this, and all of them stared at me with pity in their eyes. I am more than well-off to afford a first class plane ticket any and every time I fly, but flying first class does not matter to me at all. I do not need the first class clout just to fly from one city to the next. I'm just as happy sitting in economy so long as I get to my destination. This man had no idea who I was or what my means were and assumed that I had just bought the cheapest plane ticket on the flight. Even if I had, there is absolutely no reason to publicly shame someone for their finances. If you do not have enough room on your plane for everyone to check a bag, then do not over sell the plane tickets.

Which is why I say, with sadness, that the airline has gone way, way, way downhill. The quality is low, the service embarrassingly bad, and the perks of loyalty diminished. The biggest racket is their “Premium Economy” which is significantly more than  so-called economy comfort and economy, and just disappoints every single time. Not a single perk. No easy lounge access, no wine list, repulsive cheap wine in plastic bottles, and a menu of rubbery chicken or pasta on literally every fligh.  For a long haul flight you will easily pay 2000-5000+ usd for a bit more room and recline, and nothing else.

Delta used to reward and even slightly pamper those of us forking out tens of thousands of dollars a year to fly, but not anymore.

We were forewarned, so we got to the airport early, and then jumped in line as soon as check-in began five hours before departure. The travelers who came later had to wait up to 2.5 hours to get checked in with boarding passes. Too few employees to cope with the crush. For example,  the limited number of automatic check in machines that dispense luggage tags are complicated, and not easy to use--though there was a nice lady there who tried her best to speed things along. There were only three agents for the first hour at the desk to onboard the luggage and issue boarding tickets.  The employees were helpful, but there were too few.  The carrier needs to put more people on site earlier to ease some of the wait times.  Once at the gate, however, boarding went smoothly. The new terminal is beautiful and spacious. I might also say that we were disappointed with the plane, an airbus A350. The premium economy seats weren't all that special except for the added leg room.

Even worse than this experience is they made us pay for baggage twice (180 USD for each flight). Once with Delta and a once with Virgin Atlantic.

However, I feel compelled to let the world know how I was treated by Delta Airlines.  I have been a member of their frequent flyer program for 22 years.  I have purchased first class tickets and have never asked for an upgrade.  In 2021 I flew Delta so much that I achieved Platinum Status for 2022.  Delta’s Platinum status provides a number of regional upgrades as a reward for flying so much over the course of a year.  In July I knew what my travel schedule would be for the remainder of the year so I purchased tickets to travel for September, November and my annual Christmas trip home.  I used the certificates to purchase first class seats for my travel dates.  Then on the day of my Christmas travel I printed out my first-class tickets and boarding passes for the trip.  I reached out to Delta to confirm my seats.  At that point I was told that I needed one more pass to have first class seats for my round trip travel.  I was told the young lady that I purchased the tickets in June and I have my tickets showing my travel in first class and my seat assignments for the round trip.  I was passed along from agent to agent and finally I was told that the agent who booked the trip made a mistake and I would either have to pay $1,100 or 150,000 air miles to use the ticket that I had printed out.  I was outraged to say the least.  Even though I was told by every agent that I spoke with that it was Delta’s mistake and not mine.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I had to go through Delta airlines for my check in to flight with KLM 642 and I was flying by myself with 2 heavy luggages. I was allowed to have only one luggage so I had already paid for the second. Before I went inside a Delta rep offered to help me with the luggages for the same amount of money for a cart. I listened to him and tipped him with a higher amount. At the counter I was told luggages were heavy and I needed to move the bags away if any arrangements to be made and that there was a scale to use. I went there only to find that the scale was broken so I made arrangements between two bags and went back. The attendant at the check in counter had told me to go to him directly earlier but now he said I needed to go back in line again! First, this was a terrible approach as it is a usual procedure to go back to the attendant who did the check in at the first place. When I went back in the line, another attendant called me and she said the luggages were heavy again and that I need to pay for the extra. And I said ok but for the second luggage, I  just needed to take out one item from my small carry on as the bag was supposed to be 70 lbs and there was room. She said I cannot do that and told me to step back and move the bags to the area across the check in again. As I did not have the cart, it would be a complete burden and since I already have hernia in my back and my neck I said ok and that I will never fly with Delta again! This is true and I will never do that.","Terrible Delta Check in Experience","false","false"

"Desktop","2","review","2",,"HND to DTW flight experience was overall good but once we got to DTW this is when everything went into shambles. Our original connecting flight was canceled last minute due to weather which is understandable however no hotel or meal voucher given or offered. Delta counter agents attempted to rebook our flights but could not find anything for us and told us the next flight out was NEXT WEEK. I had to personally google find the flights and return to the desk to request them to rebook me on a specific flight with a competitor. Desk agents only put us on standby flights the 2nd time we approached the desk. 

While flying prem econ from HND to DTW we were given purple luggage tag & told by the employee at the Delta checkin that we did not have to pick up our checked bags from DTW and recheck them in. When arrived at DTW and presented the purple tags, another airport employee indicated they had stopped doing this in 2019 and we had to recheck our bags. Had this employee not told us we would have missed getting our bags completely. Not sure why delta has not updated all their own employees on this process. 

When flying standby the next day after our cancellation, I saw on the Delta Fly app in the early AM there were seats available in Main/comfort/first class on the 1st flight out to YYZ. Naturally I wanted to get confirmed on this flight asap, however we were met with a 180 min wait time on chat and even longer on phone call. I waited for the agent on chat to reply while waiting standby at the airport. Chat agent finally replied asking if I wanted to get rebooked in which I said yes and asked if I would be rebooked in the same class and if they hold my ticket spot or if I had to continue to wait at the gate line. Instead of replying they transferred me to another ticketing support agent, what was the point of asking me if I wanted to rebook when he was going to transfer me?? I waited AGAIN for 40 mins in which the chat feature disconnected and indicated I had been helped when I had not been.. During this time there was a seat assigned on the standby list showing on screen but it would have been nice if the agent on chat had just provided this information or told me to wait at the gate line. The gate agent was patient/nice but not informative. There was a severe lack of communication, a big group of standby passengers all just being told to wait and no information was given. We were all chatting amongst ourselves to try to figure out what was happening. This was an extremely poor first time experience flying with delta. We had to fork on extra money for hotel, meals and incurred extra phone costs due to deltas lack of empathy and customer service.","Cancelled connecting flight - lack of communication from Delta","false","false"

We missed our connecting flight by only a few minutes (we would have had  2-hour layover) in spite of sprinting through the airport (we're in our 60s!!). We were directed to the ""Help"" desk where they said we were already booked on the next flight to SDF the next morning. We requested a voucher for a room and were denied. Apparently the claim was that the delay was weather related. Nope! No, it was because we sat on the tarmac in MEX while waiting for people to deplane. Thanks for the ""help""! So 2 old people spent the night in the airport. We definitely should have been issued a voucher.  This was serious for us.

We booked a flight from the USA to Europe in February of 2023 for May this year at a total cost of about $4,000. A few days later Delta emailed us saying that one of our flights is cancelled with no explanation whatsoever.

That was it.

That's all we got from them. No offers for a refund, no offers to reschedule, no instructions on what to do at all. We went on their website and attempted to reschedule our cancelled flight... and Delta said that they cannot do it for some obscure reason and that we needed to speak to a representative. Getting in touch with the representative was basically impossible so now we are still in limbo, not knowing if we will be able to reschedule or even get our money back- for a flight that they cancelled.

Travelers should not have to fight tooth and nail to get a refund for a CANCELLED flight, let alone having to fight just to reschedule a CANCELLED flight.

Summary: I travelled with my carryon from NYC to MSP on my way to YWG. Carryon fit perfectly on my flight from NYC - see photos. 

 Background:
I arrived from BTV via LGA to MSP with a carry on that is the correct size and was accepted at both previous airports. In BTV I did gate check the carryon as Delta asked for volunteers to do so. But from LGA-MSP I took it with me on the plane A320 and it fit comfortably in the overhead bin.
Upon arriving in Minneapolis there was an announcement by Delta about 30 mins before departure for gate check in bags to be tagged as the flight was full. So, I did that once again knowing fully well that it’s an A320 with which by carryon would fit. The bagged was tagged by Delta employee – Mina or Mind couldn’t clearly read the name
While I was attempting to board the plane at boarding when Main 2 was called I moved into the line and proceeded to the security check (for passport and boarding pass). 

Incident
 After clearing security another Delta employee – Issac starting yelling at me and shouting at me that I can’t carryon my bag as it won’t fit and that I must tag it in. At this point I was not even given a chance to respond as he kept shouting that I am not supposed to bring this bag on and that I must listen to him - his words. He then asked for my barding pass and when checking the system realized the bag was already tagged. He then asked when did I tag it and I said “she did” pointing to the lady that tagged my bag 30mins ago. 

He then came around the desk to the front where I was standing and again proceeded to shout at me “you listen to me this bag is not for carryon and either you listen to what I am saying or I will charge you for the bag”. This is when I intervened and said “ok I choose option #2 charge me for the bag and you can stop talking”. But he kept on talking and shouting at me to listen to him. At this point the other Delta employee told me to go on and board the plane.
But I said NO – I will not board until I pay for my bag as I was told by your colleague my option is to pay and I will do so. All the while other passengers are boarding with carryon smaller and bigger than my bag but they were not stopped and asked to listen to Issac. 
So, I refuse to board until I pay for by bag, so they then told me to wait at the counter, which I did. But all the while I am waiting they are pretending to be busy at the terminal but not processing my payment, although he is in possession of my credit card. 
After everyone has boarded he then attempts to process my CC but says that there is something wrong with the printer and I can’t get a receipt. He asks me for my e-mail address which I give to him and I will get a receipt by e-mail. 
 
Ethical issues:
I asked the Delta employee that processed my charge if he completed it with my CC and he said yes and I will receive confirmation by e-mail. At all times with my CC as soon as a charge is made it’s posted to my account immediately and I get noticed. 
But my CC was never charged, now it could be a technical issue and the payment will be processed at a later date. But until today 29th January, 2023 it has not been processed. I did call my CC to ask about a Delta charge and they informed me that no charge was made or is pending in my account. So, I was lied to intentionally and deliberately by a Delta employee. 

Summary:
1.	My carryon is suitable and has been used in the past, yelling at me that it’s not a carry on is not acceptable. 
2.	I was deliberately lied to by a Delta employee as no payment was attempted, issued or processed to my CC
3.	If a customer is given a choice like I was then the Delta employee should accept the customer’s choice or decision. 
4.	I was knowingly and purposely told a lie by a Delta employee. I am in possession of a CC receipt but no chare was made to my CC. This is a fraudulent document given(sent) to me by a Delta employee.
Furthermore, employees at Delta should be given training in how to deal with the paying public and how to not make incorrect assumptions about customers. As well to not use their power of authority to bully or make false claims against paying passengers. 
When Issac realized he was wrong and that my carryon is within limits and it was already checked in he became offensive and rude carrying on with his yelling and shouting at me. That’s why I chose option #2 to end the conversation and not make a scene at the airport. 
I realize that at Delta this will be overlooked as another disgruntled customer but I assure you I am not as Delta employees have certain tasks and duties the paying customers have rights as well and being reproached or looked down by anyone is not an ideal solution. Looking back on this incident the mistake I made was not filing an incident report with the airport police, which you would then have on your file. As I didn’t want to miss my father’s funeral I didn’t do that. But I regret not filing a report that I can upload to the Internet. 

But I surely won’t be flying Delta again as there are many other airlines with respectable employees that are worthier. And others, that I influence would definitely know about this incident.","Arrogant rude unprofessional Delta airline staff","false","false"

A few hours after I booked the flight, I was contacted by Delta to be told the flight out of Sydney would be delayed and I would miss connecting flights from LA, thus having a 23 hour stop over in LA. Every step of the way I was told I would get a voucher for a hotel etc - this failed to happen.  First time in LA, travelling under stressful conditions, so I decided to book a hotel in LA before I landed there. It stated on the website that I would be compensated for this cost, however this proved to be not the case. 

Every food and drink voucher provided by Delta at the airport as an offer of compensation was refused  by vendors in the airport, so it is pointless handing them out. It seemed like their tactic is to get customers to leave the desk or conversation feeling like they have been compensated in some way, but then finding out they are yet again being screwed over as the vouchers aren't accepted anywhere. 

Following my return to Sydney and despite it being expresely stated on the Delta website that hotel costs would be reimbursed along with any expenses, the Delta rep who I have dealt via email outright refused to compensate me for my incurred 23 hour stop over.

"Desktop","4","review","1",,"We used Delta on our return SYD-LAX, PDX-SYD trip to the US in December 2023. We found the entire experience very good.
Our first leg was done direct on an Airbus A350 from SYD to LAX, and we returned the same but with a connecting flight beforehand from PDX to LAX.

Delta really impressed us in some areas. All of our flights were on time and arrived close to schedule or even early. All of our baggage made it on the flight and through our connection, with no damage to glass bottles and ceramic gifts - we utilised marking our suitcases as fragile that Delta offers, and it was painless enacting this provision. The connection in LAX was flawless and really easy to navigate, and we did not need to use a shuttle bus or walk very long at all between our domestic arrival and international departure - they were in the same terminal!
The Fly Delta app is a fantastic tool - we could keep track of all seven boarding passes and all eight of our bags. It was great to know that they had all made it onboard before departing. The app also called us up to board, and issued us QR boarding passes whilst also having the paper ones - great in case you lose it.
Boarding and deplaning was mostly efficient.
The A350 had enough legroom at 190cms, but it was barely acceptable when the passenger in-front reclined. Seatbelt length was very generous. If you tend to trend wider than your fellow homo sapiens, reserving the seat next to you would probably be a good decision, or travel with a smaller travel partner so you can encroach onto them. The A319 was tight and a squeeze, but the flight was quick. The seatbelt, however, was quite short. 

Delta was weak in cabin crew friendliness and catering. Cabin crew were stale, and whilst accommodating, were not warm and friendly. The catering on long-haul international flights was quite poor. We found that our experiences with Qantas in this regard was remarkably better.

We ultimately chose Delta because of the price - we just wanted to sit down in a chair and get off of it in one piece on the other side. Delta does a fine job of doing that and at a very reasonable price. Despite this, I don't imagine being a Delta return customer, but I would still recommend.","Seamless experience in Main Cabin Economy","false","false"

My first flight was delayed over an hour due to ""mechanical issues"" causing me to miss my connecting flight in Detroit by 10-15 minutes, and passengers were not allowed to de-board the plane and opt to stay in Buffalo rather than continue with the flight. Despite requests from my daughter, who had the same connection in Detroit, Delta would not hold the plane so that I could make the connection. My daughter was able to change the itinerary so that I could still make it before midnight, but it involved me now flying 4 flights rather than 2. Again, the 3rd flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight by 10-15 minutes again, and AGAIN Delta was unwilling to hold the plane. Because of this, I was forced to stay in Atlanta overnight by myself instead of spending the holiday with my family. I reached out to Delta's customer service requesting a refund but they would only offer a $100 travel voucher (mind you, my ticket was about $260 initially) as the itinerary was already flown (despite the fact that the only reason I flew the itinerary is because I was not allowed off my plane in Buffalo). I requested numerous times to be escalated to a supervisor but the Delta customer service rep refused, and then responded saying she would no longer respond to my correspondence.

It was the last flight of the night from ATL to IAD on January 16. No employees were around at that point, I had that sinking feeling. Then a guy appeared from the gate.   I believe he was a crew manager or terminal manager. This is where the reps at other airlines would have told me I was out of luck, boarding had ended. Instead, the Delta employee went out of his way to get me on the plane within minutes, and we departed on time. 

Some airlines seem to allow a culture of airline-vs-passenger, where the reps have a chip on shoulder mentality... their goal being to win an argument with the customer, they are right, customer is wrong. This was the opposite experience. Every Delta rep was easy going, agreeable, and making every effort to help the customer and improve the experience.

Delta's partnership with WestJet is a disaster. I am never able to check in on WestJet flights through Delta's portal and when I try to log in to WestJet's system it doesn't recognize my profile. I always have to check in at the airport which means arriving extra early and it's inefficient. 

Recently I booked a non-stop round trip ticket from LAX to YVR and discovered the day before my departure that my outbound flight was canceled. I called and rebooked but they didn't have any non-stop flights for outbound so I had to take that option. On my way back, I noticed the flight was canceled again. And I did not receive any notification on that either. I had to call and rebook it myself. 

Crazy that my flights were canceled and I received no notifications about them in advance.

Our flight was supposed to leave Seoul at around 9:45 am local time, but was delayed until 9:15 pm with no explanation throughout the day! At the end they wrote up an apology letter and gave their useless airline miles for the delay.

Also with all 3 US airlines (Delta, United, AA), their service is not as good as international airlines and passengers are not served to meet at least minimum expectation - in comparison to their international airline partners and counterparts. We traveled Korean Air and in the past we have traveled other international airlines like Japan Airlines and one can tell the difference. On a flight from Boston to Seoul, Korean Air had decent quality food, served 2 meals and their service and interaction with passengers was excellent - everything was far better than Delta.

Also we booked this trip 3-1/2 months in advance and we were scheduled to arrive in Detroit on the morning of January 11. Just a couple days after booking the tickets, Delta started changing the arrival time to Detroit from morning to afternoon, then to evening - 3 months before the trip! It's almost like they show one thing to sell tickets and then then do whatever they like to your flight schedule.

It sucks how these airlines take advantage knowing well that we don't have any choice.

Their app did not work for checkin in to our international flight, then the kiosk in the terminal did the same thing the app did and just went in a loop. This caused us to have to wait in line to checking which caused us to miss our flight. They did try to rectify this and did provide credits, so that was nice. 

We decided with the unpredictable delta delays, our departure flight was delayed 3 times, we wanted to return a day earlier. This is when the biggest headaches started. I tried to rebook while we waited for our flight in Atlanta and was told that we could not rebook the flight 3 days in the future because we were enroute to our destination. Ok, so I waited until we got to our destination and tried again. We were supposed to leave on Monday and wanted to leave on Sunday instead. They tried to rebook us for Saturday and charged my card for that flight, which they the said there was an error and they couldn’t confirm. Then I told them they had the wrong day anyway and they charged me again and said the same thing for Sunday.","Worst travel experience","false","false"
"Desktop","3","review","1",,"First of all I love Delta, staff are nice, i love that there is no limit weight on carry on and personal object, their entertainment, the snacks and drinks and their legroom however this time we were out of Denver international and we did not have a great experience.

First of all since we got to Denver we saw HUGE lines at the TSA gates, so we planned ahead and decide to pop 4 hours before our flight to make it and be able to relax.

Well, staff got to their counter 2 hours  before our flight (at around 4am), with people from other flights having them earlier than us.

We had to speak to an agent as we had a minor in another reservation alone, as he joined the trip later than the original booking, we were like 5th on the line that formed since 2:15am that day and the line got HUGE. After we got our boarding passes we headed straight to TSA lines, ran to our gate and they were already boarding, so we barely made it even when we ran skipping restroom time or even getting a bottle of water.

This is no shade to the staff as they surely have a schedule they were following however I wish the airline had more common sense and opened the counters earlier when clearly there is an issue on TSA gates being overloaded due to holidays. You should not have to run for your flight to not leave you when you are arriving with plenty of time at the airport.

"Desktop","5","review","1",,"First, the excellent: My flight from PDX to MEM took me through SLC and the crews on all of my flights to MEM and home again were exceptional. Funny, professional, and obviously hard working. The other passengers on the flights - which, I know, Delta cannot control - were also wonderful, so that added to the overall wonderful experience. Delta offered drinks and snacks, which aren't givens on every airline and I was pleasantly surprised, as this was not something I anticipated. And the snacks were tasty! I highly recommend the granola bar.
I was on my home bound flight from SLC to PDX when I realized that I'd left my unchecked, no-name-on-it-anywhere reusable grocery bag full of personal items in the overhead compartment of the plane from MEM to SLC. Crud. I let a flight attendant know, and let him know also that it wasn't an emergency. While I wanted my items back, there's really nothing more he can do than what he did, which was to give me a card with the web address of the system Delta uses for lost items. You go online, you fill out the form, and you hope for the best. Fill out the form ASAP or you can't expect to get your stuff back.
Considering I filled it out on the Friday of Thanksgiving weekend, I didn't expect anyone would be looking for lost and found til the following week. On Sunday I got an automated email letting me know that Delta was hard at work looking for my items. This was comforting insofar as there was a system in place to give the impression that action is being taken, and not comforting insofar as I am skeptical that anyone was looking for anything - still, I appreciated the gesture. A week later I got the same automated email. Shoot. Pretty sure my stuff is gone.
Two and a half weeks later, days shy of the three weeks Delta gives their peeps to find your stuff, I got an email that they'd found my bag!! Hooray!
This is where things get less excellent. Look, running a lost and found must be crazy making at the best of times, so I understand this is an inefficient, doing-the-best-we-can *for you, you forgetful passenger* situation and I'm glad they have a lost and found AT ALL. Having said that, it's a MINIMUM of $35 for them to FedEx ground your bag to you. Your stuff isn't flown on a plane from where it landed to your home airport. Somehow, my stuff was mailed from a middle-of-nowhere industrial park in Alabama. HUNH? Yes. And of all things, the items that did not make it back to me were three, one-pound bags of dried beans and a bag of loose leaf black tea. I know it sounds odd, but I'm pretty strapped, and you may've noticed that food is really expensive these days. As it is, a friend paid for the return delivery because I don't have $35. So, the loss of the foodstuffs kinda bummed me out. It's clear the bag was sorted through because the beans were at the bottom - being the heaviest items - and the loose leaf tea was tucked into a mug that was in a blister pack. The mug was still in the blister pack, but the tea was gone. So... you know, not awesome, but also not the end of the world and I'm very glad to have the mug back as it was my dad's and he's dead.
In summary, Delta's flight attendants are some of the best anywhere, and it's a miracle Delta was able to find my untagged, unlabeled bag and return it to me in actually great condition considering it had zero padding or protection. Everything was in good condition, and I'd recommend Delta to anyone. If you lose your bag, have patience and act IMMEDIATELY. Like, within the same day if possible. The longer you wait the longer the odds become it'll get found.

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"Rewind to almost 6 months ago–my partner and I sit on the tarmac for two hours (12am-2am) waiting to take off. We're not allowed to leave the plane–then told the pilot isn't coming so the flight is cancelled. Everyone floods the service desks for free hotel vouchers. But plot twist–it's too late at night for hotels to even give you a reservation for the night, and Delta says they have no hotel openings anyways. So my partner and I curl up on the floor until our new flight at 7am. But the plus (I thought) was getting my ecredit for the flight issue. I can live with all of this. But fast forward to this past week...the ecredit I was given isn't usable from my online account- it says I have to contact support. So I go to their messenger app - which never loads for me. So I try using their texting app in my phone. After it taking LITERALLY 20 minutes between their responses, and two hours of trying to use my ecredit for an upcoming flight to Florida, I'm finally given a conformation number. But then I get an auto-generated message saying I'm being transferred to a different department about my e-ticket. Apparently, this next service agent had no insight into my situation so was very useless and just told me how much ecredit I had. I thought I was officially booked on the flight. That doesn't clear up the issue that he's telling me the incorrect amount of ecredit I have- anyways, I figure he's just letting me know how much ecredit I have left and I thank him and exit. Well, today I went to check my flight reservation and it doesn't exist. Oh and also when you have to book through an agent, their flight prices are always somehow more expensive on their than what I see. A scam. Fraud. I don't have my flight and I'm supposedly out $450 of an ecredit. Absolute crime. Nevermind you have to pay extra for sitting in ""Main Cabin"" to even earn skymile points now. I have the Delta AMex card and it no longer lets me choose my seat or help me earn miles–just exists. Oh, that's right, I get to be in boarding group 1. I think that's the only benefit.

I was beyond devastated to hear that I would not be seeing my family this Christmas, considering I live by myself out here.

To make matters worse, my fiancé was scheduled to join me in Seattle from his family event in Grand Rapids, but his flight got canceled, as well. We then booked him a flight home to SLC on the 24th, which was canceled 5 hours before takeoff. I was unable to spend Christmas with my own fiancé. He was then booked a flight home on the 27th, which was AGAIN, canceled 10 hours before takeoff. He is currently scheduled to come home on the 28th, but I’m also expecting that flight to be canceled.

I am beyond frustrated with Delta and their lack of flexibility during the holiday season.

Then our driver stopped on the side of the road to get something, not sure what it was and not sure I want to know. We met with the rep at our hotel where he tried to upsell us on everything. He showed us a pamphlet for a tour with Cucurumbe Tours in Cozumel with snorkeling, lunch, dune buggies, shopping and tequila tasting so our party of 13 agreed to do that tour. We had a party of 5 within the party of 13 and didnt want to do the shopping or tequila tasting so we asked if we could break off and do the submarine tour he said that was fine and we wouldn't miss the snorkeling and the dune buggy. So we get to the ferry on the main land where were were guided to a pop up table within a store where this tour company told us it was going to be $25 each person to get onto the island, they said the government requires this tax. Upon looking it up it is only $12.  So we finally make it to Cozumel and the Delta Vacations rep told them that only 2 of us were going to break off not 5 like we originally told him and because of that we were going to miss the dune buggy part of our excursion. The res of the family went to the dune buggy part and they said it was not as advertised because the buggies were Nissan cars with no doors an they were manual not automatic and the brakes did not work. I asked for a refund for that part of the excursion from the delta vacations rep and he did not respond to me.

In summer of 2022 I was booking flights back from Europe for my family and they double charged me for same flights and took them 3 weeks to refund the money. 

In December they canceled our flights to Colorado last-minute two days in a row, and would not rebook us until well half way into our vacation. Insultingly they tried to offer us a layover flight in Los Angeles, on day 4 and even that without a guarantee that would make our direct flight I paid more for, an 8 hour travel. We spent two days including Christmas Eve trying to get a resolution with customer service (if you can call it that). We lost all the money we paid for our stay in Colorado, and ended up staying in Atlanta for the holidays with no plans, and no vacation days left. 

My emotions aside, this company simply does not feel the need to care for their passengers. Our well being and experience simply takes the backseat, and their frontline people hide behind the process and simply shrug it off. We are simply cargo to them, and cargo can be shuffled around and delayed with no consequences. They surely do not live up to their tone-deaf advertisements they make us watch prior to takeoff. 

What grinds my gears even more is that they will make you move a pound of language from one bag and right into another because of 'weight limit'... Defies all logic. All bags - by weight and volume still ends up on the same plane. 

Why would a company have processes in place to add to the passenger (cargo) frustration, and intentionally not do anything about it. They fully capable to provide everyone care, but they make conscious effort to not do that.

First and foremost, your employees are amazing from the people that helped us at the airport and on the airplane. I’m assuming the people on the grounds are also working as hard as they can. But you as a company suck. 
You have over-extended yourself and make promises to customers that you never follow through with and you believe that your vouchers and your credits will make it better. I don’t travel a ton. In fact, maybe once a year, but I am seasoned. I have never flown Delta until this time to Hawaii from Denver. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Delta behaved like it never knew any type of weather existed or knowledge of the workings of an airport. I understand there are always going to be limitations. I have been through delays but nothing like this. 

My first delay from this trip was due to weather from another city - fine.  But it was delayed even further because when we were got to Seattle, there wasn’t a loading bridge that could unload us from the airplane - it was coming from the S gate to the A gate and the pilot didn’t know why. We missed our flight to Hawaii by 10 minutes and couldn’t get one until the next day. If you don’t have the workers/materials or have the workings of the flight even if delayed planned out, don’t make these promises that you can get us there. Do your due diligence and make sure things are running smoothly at the airports you do business at. The next day when we flew out of Seattle to Hawaii - they had to taxi us back due to mechanical issues. After about 45 minutes, I thanked the mechanics after they departed and we were off. Better safe than sorry for this delay. And now that I’m thinking about it, this was Hawaiian airlines. 

I do have to say when we did land in Hawaii that day, the luggage people at Delta went way beyond my expectations! It was waiting at their customer service office. 

Coming home from the LA airport was also a terrible experience. We were of course delayed (no reason given) which was fine but when we were all boarded, we were having issues with the push off tug and we were delayed another hour because we had to wait for another one then when we finally made it to Denver at around 11:30, we had to sit on the plane for two hours with really no true explanation as to why. There were two planes that passed us by & they both went to their unloading gate. I understand weather, I understand shortages of workers but Delta acted as if does not. Don’t offer flights if you can’t follow through to just attempt to get us to the gate in a timely manner. 

Again the employees were top notch except for your customer service via chat - they couldn’t do nearly as much as when we waited in line for two hours to talk to a human which I’ll never understand why either - my questions were the same.

Understandable… but they had to wait for personnel to finish and should have been prepared. We got to our seat and put our small carry on in the overhead bin. People were coming on w oversized luggage- not one but three bags some of them. We noticed trash around our seats. After most of the people boarded they came to our overhead bins to make room and asked some of the other first class passengers to put bags u set their seats. We didn’t pay for first class to have baggage under the seats, we paid for the extra leg room and comfort. One bag broke the over head bin, we watched as someone shoved it in and forced it close. They we hear the attendant say we are over weight as people brought in too many bags- was no one checking?? We brought two small back packs and one tiny purse so we followed the rules, not many others did. Bags were then pulled and tracked to the owners- further delaying the flights. I write this as we watch and wait as the attendants try to get us under weight. We have been delayed an hour so far. I would expect a lot more for a first class ticket.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"I’ve had really lousy experience with Delta twice which resulted in responses that were rigid and non responsive.  How they rank #1 is hard to understand.

Some time ago, I flew first class many times on a flight from LGA to TPA.  The flight was billed as departing at 3:59 PM.  That’s an interesting time, as dinner service is policy for flights that depart at. 4PM.  They had a flakey excuse - flights that leave within 15 minutes are considered  “on time” as if it was still 3:59.  I pointed out that of 8 consecutive flights they actually left (defined as pulling back from the gate) at 3:59 only twice, and on some Ocasio s they missed the 15 minute window.

Response?  A rigid, non responsive 3:59 is not 4:00.  No reply to the assertion that they gamed the syste, to save money on the meal service.

Now….just last week I took a early AM flight from TPA to LGA for doctor visits.  First class because I am immunocompromised and first class seats are less congested and have more leg room.  I have two surgically replaced knees.

Delta continuously emailed me,  they confirmed my reservation.  They asked me what I wanted  for breakfast (to save $ from waste).  They reminded me to check in and print my ticket.  They told me the gate assignment.

I arrived early - first in line to board.  I scan my ticket and up pops a little slip of white paper.  I asjpk what it is - gate check person says “read it”.  Ah, turns out I’m not in first class anymore,  not even Comfort Plus.  I’m at the back of the plane in basic economy.

I tell the gate people about my health issues and that the new seat assignment puts me at great risk.  They say the equipment was downsized from a 321 to a 319 and changes were made algorithmically.  I say, surely a human can override a computer and since no one else has boarded, the change can be made subtly without ruffling anyones feathers.  NOPE.  A guy comes over and says wait here - and comes with a $200 voucher (not telling me that’s policy for anyone being bumped from first class).  He says board now and I will try to do something to solve your problem.  He does this knowing that the door is scheduled to close in 5/10 minutes and never shows up.

I called to find out when they knew that there was an equipment change and when I would be bumped to the back of the plane.  Turns out it was 10/12 hours.

Yet with all the emails, they couldn’t give me the advance notice so that I could try any of the many airlines flying from TPA to the NY area airports.  Because they got my payment and they mean t9 keep,it, even if it gets naked for future flights.

I complain.  They say, okay, we will give you 7500 points (less than half the price of a basic economy ticket Imwill never use.

No response about the behavior of their gate people.  No apology for placing me at serious health risk.  

Just mechanical statements.  They have the right to change equipment.  They refunded the difference.  Now beat it (in effect).  And to rub salt in the wound, they sent me an email asking me to rate the first class breakfast thst I was never served.  

They refused to address why with all the correspondence, they didn’t use the time to let me know of the change.  They declined to address the behavior of gate personnel.

After I pointed it out, they told me they were sorry I was wasting my time writing to them.

They are simply the worst. Returning from vacation on a Delta Airlines flight tainted the whole trip due to a maintenance issue that was known about before passengers were allowed to board. 
The crew's decision to put passengers on a potentially faulty aircraft caused a significant delay and added inconvenience and cost to our travels. It could have easily been avoided if the crew had taken the necessary precautions and proactively rescheduled the passengers for alternative flights, but their hesitancy caused a whole flight of people to have missed connections.

To add insult to injury, Delta managed to suck any fun out of traveling with their poor service and lack of consideration for their customers.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"TL;DR: do not become a loyal Delta customer and transfer points to book a Delta flight. Their search is completely broken, showing flights that aren't bookable.

The details:

I transferred points into the Delta Skymiles account: ****8795 from Amex because I saw the flight available for points for Delta One, screenshot attached from Sunday 12/11. Flying from BKK to YUL on July 22nd, 2 passengers, 165k points per ticket. When I went to book the flight, it errored saying the flight had ""just sold out"". When I went to reload the page, the flight was still there. I tried several times 12/11, 12/12 and got a similar error. Starting 12/13, I got a different error that my payment did not go through. This error persisted with multiple different types of payment, all saying the flight had ""sold out"".

I spoke to a representative from Delta on 12/12 who explained there is an issue on the site where flights show up as available to book with points that aren't actually available, and this has been going on for ""over a month"". Delta has a known issue where loyal members cannot book flights but are now obligated to keep points in Delta.

I spoke to another representative today 12/14 from Delta who saw the flight I was trying to book (another screenshot attached dated to this day) for the same 165,000 points per ticket for Delta One (as I’m trying to book 2 tickets). They got the same error, contacted Korean Air, who denied the flight. For reference, there are over a dozen Delta One flight options to book with cash, several of which show up to book with points, but throw an error and won’t go through with Korean Air. I am flexible on times and have tried a few different flights, departing 9:35pm or 11:30pm from BKK with different layovers eventually arriving to YUL.

With my points in Delta already due to misinformation, I am unable to book the flight with points and unable to transfer the points back to Amex. This is absolutely unacceptable.

I was hoping Delta could help by filing a complaint with them in private (case number 06668841), but apparently this issue isn't one that corporate or customer service are willing to handle.

We spent countless hours on the phone trying to track the bags and after 4-5 weeks, we were told by several people not to expect it and to purchase the items lost.  We spent a lot of money on a CPAP, an entire business wardrobe etc,  The bag was then found 2 months later and was returned which we were happy about but, we did spend a lot of cash replacing items that we thought were lost. We have reached out so many times, I can't keep track. they just don't respond.  I'm a platinum member and my husband is gold.  You would think they would treat their loyal customers better.

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"This is a complaint filed by my mother-in-law to Delta Airlines: This was a big trip for me. My granddaughter was getting married and I was unable to arrange for ground nor train transportation to get from Buffalo, NY to Cookeville, TN. I had to fly and I am terrified of heights and the thought of flying. This was my first time flying, so due to my disability and being wheelchair bound, I arranged for seat 1A in first class on Delta to provide a short distance from the entrance and to the bathroom.  I was made to walk from the entrance to my seat which is a significant distance for a person with my disability since the chair+me was too wide to fit through the corridor between the entrance and First Class. My first flight was delayed many hours before boarding. Upon arrival to LaGuardia, Delta misplaced my battery powered wheelchair (bright red and rather large), so I was not permitted to depart the flight. My chair was eventually located and I deplaned. Due to the flight delay, I had missed my connecting flight on Delta. There were no other direct flights for the 17th, so I was booked on a flight for the 18th at 7:15 am. The airline said they would put me up at a hotel across the street (reservations were made at a different hotel a good distance away from the airport at approximately 45 minutes drive). My daughter verified with the airline representative that they would guarantee to have me back from the hotel at LaGuardia for my flight in the morning. They said they would. They did not. Instead, they gave me a taxi service phone number. My van from the airport was delayed and then changed by dispatch to a different van. The hotel representative helped me request the taxi back to LaGuardia since I had trouble hearing the taxi dispatcher. We requested a wheelchair van, but the taxi company sent a car. They had to request the wheelchair van which caused an additional delay. When the wheelchair van finally arrived, it took me to JFK even though I told them to go to LaGuardia (I believe there was a communication breakdown since the hotel front desk representative also told them LaGuardia). So, I missed my Delta flight. I was rebooked for a direct flight from JFK to Nashville a couple hours later which was also delayed. For the rebooking, I also lost my 1A seat and was made to sit 2D window seat (I am not a mobile person and this was virtually impossible for me to do even with help from the 3 skycaps, who were amazing). On top of all of this, the Delta Representative at LaGuardia provided me two meal vouchers for $15 each which I was only able to use the one due to my early morning departure time, not to mention that you can't buy much of anything of substance for $15 in NYC. When my flight was rebooked, I couldn't use the 2nd meal voucher since it had already expired. I was also provided a delta dollars ecredit of $100, but with what I have gone through, it is clearly not enough to put myself through this nightmare again. The return flight was less eventful, but it had issues as well, from the lack of wheelchair assistance (we couldn't find anyone to assist me for about an hour) to the delayed flights and I was fortunate that they actually held my connecting flight to Buffalo. We landed in Buffalo around 10:40 pm.","My First time Flying","false","false"
"Desktop","1","review","2",,"Originally, my husband and I planned this trip over 7 months in advance. We hoped to go from Houston to London connecting in Paris. We noticed the connection and thought it would be nice to stay in Paris instead. When we contacted the airline, they were not accommodating. We tried changing the tickets and offered to pay a penalty. Their answer was that if we changed our plans, they would cancel our return flight or charge us current market value for the ticket, which is 6 times the amount we paid for. They were not willing to let us cancel the last flight from Paris to London even though they could re-sell the tickets and earn even more money from our change. This was extremely disappointing, and awful customer service. Our intent was not to get a cheaper flight to Paris, the cost when we purchased the ticket would have been the same, we were only asking for some flexibility and the ability to give them back our last ticket. Instead, we were met with hefty fees and having to purchase another flight to return to the connecting flight destination. It was very poor customer service. I would not recommend this airline to travel to Europe from the US.","No flexibility and threats to cancel return flight","false","false"

How wonderfully surprised we were on so many counts.
Firstly, we had such great trouble trying to pay for our seats online once we had confirmed check in. 

Eventually we got through to a Delta Call Centre Representative who was so, so helpful and a real person (not automated voice). He was so reassuring that we had managed to check in and had our seats together and it would be perfectly OK to pay for our bags at the bag crop counter without compromising our check in and seat allocation. 

True to his word, when we arrived at JFK Delta Passenger Assist Counter, Rei was so, so helpful and professionally kind.  

The Plane was so much bigger than we imagined and the Flight Team so welcoming and attentive.  

The greatest surprise was the complimentary infight Movie entertainment which is wonderful and makes the basic economy experience for 6+ hours really go quickly and quite painlessly lol

We would like the General Manager of JFK Delta Team to acknowledge Rei 
(I apologise we did not quite catch the name of the very helpful Man from the Delta call Centre but it was Friday afternoon around 3,00pm- and would like him Acknowledged too) 

Rei your professionalism and genuine kindness made 2 quite stressed and anxious Aussie Passengers very calm. 
You are a credit to your Aviation Profession and your Family,

When the plane finally arrived at the gate, they serviced the plane real quick and quickly got us all boarding onto the plane. Mostly everyone on board had connections in Atlanta and due to the delay, they were very tight connections. Thanks to the Pilots and the tailwind, we arrived in Atlanta 35 minutes late instead of 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I got to the gate to my connection, they just started boarding. I was so worried I was going to miss my last flight. All of the FA's (which were both San Francisco and Atlanta based) were very friendly and accommodating, which made my flight more enjoyable. Drinks were provided, then snacks were handed out, then another drink service was offered. I feel as if people only want to write a review when they experience something negative on their flight, and not when they have a positive flight experience.

We both got approved for 2 weeks in December for our anniversary trip and not to mention, she is from there and hasnt been back since she moved to the USA 13 + years ago. Delta decided that for *their* convenience, they would take the liberty of adjusting our flight to have a 5 hour layover in new york. I specifically set up the flight so that it would be direct, not a 10 - 12 hour experience. Her family is supposed to meet us at the airport, and rolling in at midnight on 12/1 is not going to work for them. We also booked a rental to be picked up on 12/2 and this causes obvious problems with that too. I called, the first representative was very bland and not empathetic to the situation at all, so i asked to be transferred to a manager. The manager, Mark, was also extrodinarily bland and refused to do anything about it. He said the only thing he was willing to do would be to either schedule us on a flight later in the day for less layover time (but still landing at midnight) or push our trip back a whole day to the following day. Major inconvenience considering the car situation, its our anniversary, and the fact that when i book a flight - it is booked for what works with our schedule. I dont book it to be chopped and screwed around for the airlines convenience. When i asked mr. Mark for a partial refund or a voucher/upgrade, he would not do it and again was very bland. To put it bluntly, ill not be flying delta in the future and ill be sure to share my experience everywhere i am able to review this airline/anytime anyone in my life brings up wanting to take a trip anywhere.

We were offered meal and food vouchers; but what food can be purchased after 11 pm in the airport? There were no options to use the meal vouchers. In addition, the closest hotel option was 17 miles from the airport. So, Delta can’t provide hotel options that are closer to the airport? Many of the passengers, including myself, chose the option of sleeping at the gate until the flight was ready to board the next day. A cart was brought out with an assortment of snacks and water, and later blankets were provided for those who chose to stay at the gate. I then overheard other customers discussing an additional $100 voucher that was given to them by Delta. So I went up to the counter and requested a voucher myself. The voucher states that an email would be sent, containing instructions on how to redeem this gift card. This telephone number was provided, 1-877-895-5745, to call if the email was not received. I called, and the number is constantly busy.

1. SO DELTA ALLOWED CUSTOMERS TO BOARD A PLANE ALTHOUGH THERE WASN’T ADEQUATE STAFFING TO FLY THE PLANE

2. DELTA THEN PROVIDED VOUCHERS, 2 MEAL VOUCHERS THAT COULD NOT BE USED….AND A HOTEL VOUCHER FOR HOTELS THAT WERE FAR AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT

3. DELTA ONLY OFFERED CERTAIN PASSENGERS THIS $100 GIFT CARD, BUT NEVER FOLLOWED THRU WITH PROVIDING THE EMAIL NEEDED FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REDEEM IT

4. DELTA PROVIDED A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, WHO REQUIRE HELP REDEEMING THE GIFT CARD, BUT IT’S ALWAYS BUSY

5. DELTA HAS NOT TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORT COMINGS REGARDING THIS FLIGHT DELAY

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"Delta Air Lines is terrible. They take no accountability for their own policies or mistakes. Back in August I had to get a fast flight home due to a family member having covid, and ps I was also exposed though I never got it. I purchased an upgraded seat so I wouldn't have to worry about carry-on luggage, so I could board early, and stay away from as many people as possible and not have to wait at baggage claim when I landed. At the gate on my layover at JFK they said they had limited room and if you were in a later boarding zone you would have to check a bag (I was not). I had a normal carry on roller bag and a tiny roller bag to go under my seat. I was within the policies for size. Despite this, when I checked in the gate agent was extremely rude and told me because the tiny bag was a roller bag it was against their luggage rules. It is not. I have flown with this bag for years and never had an issue. She, for whatever reason had it out for me. She forced me to check the bigger bag and told me that I could not put the smaller bag under my seat. She was condescending and rude and went so far as to board the plane to check that I didn't put my bag under the seat. Now at the time I needed to get home more than I needed to be right. So I dealt with it. It was humiliating and infantilizing. I told Delta about my experience. Not only did it take them until November to get back to me, they basically just said oh well, were sorry. No accountability, no offer for any type of repair at all. No credit of the difference of the upgraded fair, despite my request. they even admitted to asking for reports from their staff and not recovering them, regarding this situation. My partner has also had terrible issues with them being rude and awful. I will ever fly them again. I normally fly Southwest Airlines to avoid issues like this especially with luggage and I tried them because I was in a pinch but I'd honestly rather rent a car and drive than be treated like trash by angry power hungry staff.

"Desktop","1","review","3",,"I have a legitimate complaint with Delta Airlines customer service or lack thereof. When we decided to book back in July ( we were flying to Quito (thru Atlanta) I had three choices of the Toronto leg. 1:00pm, 7:55am and 6:15am. We chose to pay $200.00 more to take the 7 hour less itinerary. Delta gladly took our money and subsequently changed our flight twice. The 1st change to the 7:55am flight and then most recently to the 6:15am flight. The other 2 flights no longer exist. I was forced to take the 6:15am flight with no alternative but to cancel and rebook. This is a scam. Delta knew they were going to cancel the 1:00pm 7:55am flights and move everyone to the 6:15am flights but they knew they could get more money from those passengers who wanted a shorter itinerary. This is unethical and dishonest. If they cancel or cannot provide what I paid for them I expect to be compensated, at the very least to the original price of the 6:15am flight when I originally made my booking. Creating higher priced more convenient flights, hoping people will book and pay for them, but knowing full well they will never actual honour that schedule is dishonest and unethical. But now they have my higher priced fare and i had no choice but to take the 6:15am anyway with no offer of anything. I also has to spend 8 hours more in an airport in Atlanta with no offer of compensation for this extra time. No food vouchers, not even free lounge access with a business class ticket. I asked at the airport Delta desk and was told too bad. It is not there policy to compensate passengers in this was. I wrote to their customer service Dept on Sept 4th, 2022 when I received the second flight change. I received a response from them on Nov 9th, 2022, even though their automated response to my email said I would receive a response in 7-10 days. Pathetic customer service. Their response was a standard thank you for taking the time in writing us and apologizing for the delayed response because they  have been inundated with incoming calls and correspondence, fee I wonder why?

They quoted their policy of having the right to change scheduled but never once even acknowledged the money we were out because we paid a higher price for the original faster schedule. They keep saying  their goal is to make every effort to resolve the issue and yet all they do is quote their policy which clearly protects them and has no value to the customer. 

With regard to my compensation request, which was only asking for the fair difference I paid for the better scheduled flight, the customer service rep said that they have gone over what happened and once again, in accordance with their policies, a refund was not warranted for this matter. I am not sure then in what situation a refund would ever be warranted according to their policies. They should just say that their policies is NO REFUNDS or COMPENSATION for anyone EVER. 

Their response was so rehearsed and robotic.  No empathy, no real concern, just hiding behind policy and throwing out token apologies. Pathetic really. Delta has lost a customer, and they will continue to lose customers if they are treated this way. I will NEVER fly the, again on principal alone. Pathetic response time, over two months to respond to a legitimate complaint and then when they did respond, nothing but quoting policy which had nothing to do with the situation.

TUS to ATL was ok   ATL to JFK ok.  JFK to LIS we had 'rubber' chicken for dinner, and once in LIS a miserable time trying to find our way to the Metro.  

Flight from LIS to JFK ok, ate noodles.  JFK a mess, and the terminal was far from where it should have been due to construction.  Getting through customs was a problem as Global Entry machines did not recognise me.  Had to take peoplemover, bus, and long walkways to get to the JFK to ATL gate.  

Flight left 30-minutes late and we now has to worry about our ATL to TUS connections, but were assured that the TUS terminal was right next to the ATL terminal, NOT SO.. Long distance away.  We got our connection, but only after running the obstacle course called an airport.  

Flight into TUS was great until the last 20 minutes when we hit rough air, and the cabin crew went to the floor to keep from getting harmed.  We touched down in a mix of wind shear and wing-tip flapping.  The pilot did a great job of landing, but it was scary.  

OTHER:  The on-board touch screens on all the flights either did not work, or stopped working during the flight.  The seats were not reclining seats, except for one that reclined on its own.

I initially planned to fly with 2 bags. After paying the $70 fee online, I realized I didn’t need two bags, everything fit into one. No problem. Im sure they would be willing to adjust the cost and apply it to my return flight. 

Nope. Man at the service counter advised I had to fly first to prove I only had one bag then to call customer service (CS). Ummm, odd but ok. 

Had 3 plane changes, yes 3. Almost missed a connecting flight because we landed at the same time the flight was boarding and you never board from the same area or near by gate. Oh no!

The CS gal, who was amazing by the way, told me that I should have called with in 24 hours. The man at the service counter did not tell me this. But not that it really mattered, since she can’t do refunds anyway. It’s against Delta policy, and she has no way of verifying that I really only flew with one bag.

Fun side note….The Delta website in not user friendly for my ISO iPhone. It does not operate correctly, which is all I had at the time. Foolish me for leaving my laptop. Also, the complaint/request area is so buried I would have never found it with the CS agents help.

As a good customer I obliged when asked at check-in to check my carry-on from Split via Amsterdam and Salt Lake City arriving in PHX at midnight.

Well in SLC my carry on did not arrive.  The Delta desk was not even able to pull up my tracker number.  And said ""it'll probably be fine"" ... it was not, at midnight it did not arrive with me in PHX.

Here's where things improve.  Wisely the Lost Baggage desk for Delta at Sky Harbor has complimentary snacks and drinks on offer.  The two people who assisted me were very polite - not in that I don't want to be way - but genuinely.  They were knowledgable, took a lot of effort looking for my bag, filling  the claim ticket, explaining the process to me.  

I left thinking I was in as good a set of hands as possible.

Left it for 2 days, then called the number on the claim ticket, expecting not much.  Surprised to find them quick, helpful and courteous and not bored to death.

They let me know my bag was on the way.

Left it for 2 days, given up on the bag emotionally.  And started thinking through content for claims purposes.

Then I got a very cheerful call from Delta to let me know my blue bag was on the way.  I tracked it on the app, it arrived very shortly after, the driver sent me a message saying it was delivered!

I grabbed my bag and could see by the many, many luggage tags that it had been on a journey!

So very pleased with how all that was handled - well done Delta lost and found.  

And no, probably won't fall for ""check your bag they said, it will be ok they said"" again.","Lost ""checked carry-on""","false","false"
"Desktop","1","review","3",,"am writing to you after the horrible experience my wife and I had on flight 265, the night of October 15,2022. The left engine would not start and we stayed on the plane, on the tarmac for 6 hours! The mechanics were working on it, while we sat, and sat, and sat on the plane. All that we were offered during the first few hours was a bottle of water! Eventually we were fed dinner, but WE HAD TO STAND IN LINE(see enclosed attachment) to go to the galley to get our food tray!  We also had to bus our own tray after we finished earting(the staff would not clean it for us). Why were we not served by the staff on board?? I have never been on a flight where we have to stand in line to get food. Can you explain to me why this happened?
It only gets worse. Eventually the engine was fixed, but the staff on the plane did not want to go. They said it was too late, and Delta rules did not permit them to exceed a certain number of hours. The pilot and his cockpit officers wanted to fly to New York. I have to say that they were outstanding. The cabin staff was terrible .
Now we had to leave the plane. Our suitcases were left on the plane as it was so late that there were no workers around. It took 20 minutes for them to open the doors to leave the plane. Why did that take so long? We were already on the plane for over 6 hours.
Then we weren't directed anywhere so we all just started to walk and ask where Delta Customer Service was? We got to a line and was met by several agents who handed us a voucher for a taxi, and a voucher for a hotel(see attached enclosure). She could not help us get a hotel, and she said to call a taxi . We were left to fend for ourselves, in a foreign country, after midnight!
It seems that Delta did bus 75 people to a hotel but we and many others were not so fortunate. How do you just help out some customers and not others?
So we did was was convenient for us. That was to walk to the Sheraton Hotel connected to the airport. We could not get through to a taxi, or find a hotel on the phone when we don't speak French,  after midnight.
The following day also had its delays. After boarding the plane we had to sit on it for over an hour after the doors were closed. The mechanics had to come onto the plane to even out the fuel because the previous night had one engine on and the other never started. Therefore the fuel distribution was not correct. Why wasn't this resolved during the night or in the morning before we boarded the plane? There was ample time to resolve this then so we did not have to spend another hour on tarmac.
The stress from this experience was overwhelming. We had no clothes to change into, as our luggage was on the plane. My medications were in that luggage! Many mistakes were made, and there was no proper support from Delta. At least have a representative meet us when we left the plane to tell us where to go. The airport was closed already for the night.  We were left with no empathy from the staff. Vouchers are not the answer. Personal help is the answer and that was non existent. A wonderful vacation was ruined by Delta. My wife is traumatized, and it will be awhile before she gets back on a plane.What are you going to do to rectify this for us? I will wait to hear from you before I post on travel websites about this experience.

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"We used our Delta sky miles to book our return trip home from Dublin, Ireland to Toronto, Canada, going onto Atlanta.  Here are the reasons we will never do West Jet from anywhere again, and question Delta's management decisions on this.  

We did not know West Jet was involved until we tried to get our boarding pass 24 hours before.  West Jet was unable to complete our boarding pass because of a glitch with the covid information, which is no longer needed.  Should have been our first ""clue"".    

When we got to the boarding gate, we and most of the other passengers on the trip were stunned to see a small, domestic sized airplane out on the tarmac, with stairs at the entry door.  Yes, they expected us to board via the stairs ""Ryan Air"" style with our suitcases.  That was just the beginning.  

This small airplane had extremely tight seating, with no internet, TV or other means of entertainment for a 7 hour trip across the Atlantic.  if you did not upload the WestJet app, you just got to sit and stare at the back of the seat in front of you for 7 hours.  
The seats were so tight, I actually have a sore right side from sitting in them for 7 hours! Delta should have informed us of this before we continued on with this reservation. 

The fight should have taken 5 to 6 hours from Dublin.  Because the plane was so small, it took 7 and there was a good bit of turbulence the whole time.  I never felt safe until my husband saw land 5.5 hours later. 

The flight service team was small and overwhelmed.  
We saw them for a hot sandwich in a McDonalds box, trying to be a turkey sandwich, and a drink.  
We saw them once again for a walk through the small cabin to ask if anyone wanted water, and again for a final drink and snack. No one told us what was going on, where we were, or zip.  We did get a fasten seat belts message because of the turbulence, which was constant. Talk about flying blind... and pondering what was Delta thinking.  
My guess is money.   

They did take our bags from the Ryan Air steps to the cargo of the plane, and then had them out at the door exit, which luckily had a regular gate, so did not have to do the stairs down.  There were several older seniors on board who struggled with the stairs.  Again , someone from Delta should have told us this was going to be the case and we would have checked our bags.  

There was a steady line to the 2 restrooms on the small plane.  
The crew was not helpful or friendly or even reassuring in any way.  
A Crew member from West Jet said that even they were surprised about the service, size of the plane and time it took to cross the Atlantic.  

We are now over being shocked, and now we are just disappointed with Delta,  
If you find yourselves on a West Jet flight from  Dublin through Delta, do your homework on what you are getting into.  We will be considering other airlines for our future trips to Europe or anywhere else overseas.

Horrible gate boarding experience and unorganized efforts in relieving an overweight plane due to overbookings and too much cargo.

First, they unloaded 10000 pounds of general cargo, then asked for 13 passengers to deplane voluntarily in exchange for $. They chose the passengers, then after everyone had deplaned, did they realize they would not be able to unload their luggage without unloading all of the baggage. They had to reboard, then opted to remove another 10000 pounds of cargo. This is the information we were given. God only knows what else was going on for Delta to take 3 hours to figure it out.

I thought using my points through Delta vacations would be a really good option.  I was incredibly mistaken

1). You do NOT have the 24-hour ability to cancel a trip on this site if you choose to cancel, to get your money or points back. They will only refund you in delta vacation dollars.  So don't make that mistake. They do offer the ability to cancel, but you will be stuck with one of their travel certificates that can only be used on Delta Vacations

2) Delta vacation availability of flights is very limited either in times or destinations.  If you do cancel your trip and get a travel certificate refund, you will be forced to use them and their limited choices.  For example, if you wanted to go to Taipei, Taiwan you will not find any options available.

3) The dates of available flights are also very limited.  If you wanted to go from Seattle to Berlin first class, there are no available flights.

4). The prices on this site are by far MUCH more than just purchasing it separately through other airlines.

Buyer Beware, don't make the mistake i did. if you find a good deal, great, take it.

My flight was supposed to leave at 6:14 pm. Then it was delayed to 7:33. Then, it was delayed to 7:50. Then it was finally delayed to 9:54.

I went to the Delta help desk, which only had one person helping my entire flight of 200+ people. When I finally got to speak to the representative, they said there wasn’t anything they could do, and they gave me a meal voucher. 

When I went to pay for my very simple, yet typically expensive meal, the server told me the voucher was only good for $15. Where are you going to get a meal in an airport (or anywhere in LA) for $15??

When I went back to the help desk to confront them about giving me a meal voucher that would only cover a portion of my meal, which I was forced to get because of my delayed flight, they took so long that I missed my flight.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Delta Airlines Turned My Trip with My 3 Kids into a Complete Nightmare
We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years
with different Airlines. On December, 18
th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they
requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an
employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time.
Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour
to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and
said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding
passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and
apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to
the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was
angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were
on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. I’m willing to bet that due to
extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and
allowed the plane to take off.
Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY. Guess what
happened again? When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the
employee “You knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didn’t you wait for just 2
minutes? She did not answer, but again it’s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going
to miss our flight to Israel as well. I don’t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my
voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are
nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients
At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next
flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening
that we would have to wait for ( if I’m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do
whatever needed to be done.
She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight
to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes,
but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the
flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we
got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the
Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son
for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he
already had a boarding pass, but because of Delta’s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3
flights. All they needed to do was transfer his boarding pass to the next flight. However, this process was
also taking long. They kept on asking him unnecessary questions and he was only 15. Until I blew up and
gave these idiots a piece of my mind; so they decided they were not going to help us at all. At this point,
it's obvious they had no idea of what they were doing. My son told me just put me on a plane back to
Atlanta and we should continue to Israel. Of course, I did not agree with that. We went to another Delta
desk and I told my 21 year old daughter to stay in line and I would go and use one of the phones that
connect directly to Delta. We worked on this Issue for 2 hours, which seemed as long as 2 days. Finally,
we got his boarding pass. By the end of this horrible ordeal, we were so disappointed anld so disgusted
with Delta that we promised it would be our last trip with these ignorant, incompetent, and unprofessional
people, and we would tell about our horrible experience anywhere we can","Delta turn my trip with my kids in to a nightmare","false","false"

On October 11th, 2022 I had a very disturbing experience for the first time with Delta Airlines. Vera & Camille at Gate A27 at the DTW airport had poor customer service, their rudeness and dismissive behavior was very disappointing today. The misunderstanding was in regards to my seat selection, being that I always fly first class It was to my surprise that on the second leg of my flight I was placed in main cabin. At no point did either flight attendant attempt to make my experience better, Vera stated “Either sit in main cabin or get your stuff and get off this flight, you’re holding me up”. On top of that I called customer support multiple times to resolve the matter amicably.  To my disappointment once again I was encountered by another representative that was very dismissive and unwilling to accommodate me, the customer service supervisor name is Darlene and her employee ID is C6. All three representatives for Delta were rude, dismissive, and had poor customer service. Neither of them were hospitable. Which in result forced me to arrive to my destination later than expected, missing important meetings and obligations. On top of it all I had to purchase a whole new flight for $1,300 one way from dtw to fll. I ask what is the point of being a Gold Medallion/Elite plus member if I’m going to be treated with disrespect & poor service?

The flight had 1 scheduled stop in JFK. The 1st part of my flight from Rome was delayed which would make us miss the connection in JFK.  I paid over $3000 for 2 tickets in premium and Comfort plus because my husband is 6.3 but was rebooked on a flight in the main cabin.  Then while we waited 6 hours in the Rome airport because of the first delay we were informed that the flight was going to make a stop in Amsterdam to pick up a new flight crew. This additional delay would cause us to miss the 2nd rescheduled JFK to LAX flight so it was rebooked for the 3rd time for a 9:40 pm flight. At this point we were told we would only have an hour once we landed to clear customs, get through security and get to the gate. We could have maybe made it but after the plane got to the gate to disembark the new crew that we picked up in Amsterdam could not figure out how to open the door. Needless to say we missed the last flight of the day. The only helpful person of the day helped us at 10:00 pm get a 4th attempt to fly home the next morning.

The next morning, we checked in with the Delta Guest Services Desk and thanks to Terri and Lyndon, they sorted everything out for us. They didn't ask a lot of questions but were able to figure it all out on their own. We were SO tired and frustrated and just wanted a flight home without spending 1,000's of dollars.

So, currently flown two Delta flights these last two days and experienced truly an airline that lacks communication between ground and air, as well maintenance!!  First flight is late, after landing sent to a gate with a plane parked, so waited 20-25 minutes to arrive at another gate, and there is no representative therefore need to wait another 15+minutes.  My second Delta flight is a duzzier one, plane cleaning crew works overtime cleaning our plane for 45 minutes and we are taking off late again, and then we board plane and air conditioning is not working, so it’s approximately 90 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius and we continue to wait on why we haven’t left after seated for still over 50 minutes😡.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I booked a flight from LGA to Cleveland so that I could attend a wedding. I was a groomsman for the wedding and was looking forward to participating in all of the events. I found some flights that worked for my schedule and they happened to be Delta whom I do not typically choose as travel partners. 

I had coordinated plans with people based on my itinerary but unfortunately found out, that when flying with Delta, a set schedule is always subject to change and your efforts to be a dependable person in regard to your commitment is jeopardized with their great ineptitude of being a reliable transportation service. 

It might be easiest to understand my disappointment and frustration by simply looking at the attachments of the update texts. From all of my other travel experiences, which I am fortunate and grateful to say is plenty and well above average, I usually receive 1-2 update texts mostly with confirmations of flight and gate information. Delta operates differently than their competitors however as they like to send 10-12 texts with new gate information and change of departure times. For those who like spontaneous adventures, simply book a flight with Delta and you'll be running around the airport all day with changes of departure times every 30-45 minutes! 

Unfortunately due to all of this irresponsible and unreliable service from Delta, I held many people up and changed a lot of people's schedules simply bc I didn't know when I was going to get in. Eventually plans were canceled and I, with the help of Delta Airlines, ruined a night of fun which was planned a long time in advance. 

I will say that Delta is consistent in that the return flight was just as bad. I was supposed to take off at 12:15pm and it's currently 5:15pm and our flight has now been pushed back until 7:10pm. Believe me, I'm not holding my breath! In summary though, Delta has proven to me that it is a completely unreliable travel service with little to no regard nor respect for it's customer's time nor plans. If you are someone that would like to pay the same amount of money as their competitors but have no security in when your flight will actually take off, Delta airlines is your best bet. If you purchase flights with a purpose and make plans around the set schedule the airline commits to, then you should be sure to filter out Delta in your search.","Most Unreliable Travel Service","false","false"

We carefully selected flights and seats and planned our trip. As time passed, the flights changed, but the airline assured us we were good. This morning, I noticed that one of our flights was missing on the return side. So, I started a chat to understand what had happened. The agent had difficulty locating the missing flight, so the agent advised that the ticket would be re-issued to ensure it could be located. The agent then tried to charge a re-booking fee. I questioned the fee and was sent to a manager. Upon further review, we found that the first agent booked all of our flights with a return destination to North Carolina instead of Arkansas. The following agent corrected that issue but created new ones. In the process of a nearly three-hour chat, we lost our seat assignments on flights they re-booked. After insisting on seat assignments, we ended up with terrible seats without viable options for recourse.

We did not ask for any compensation. We only requested seats be as good as we originally booked, but we ended up in worse seats than we purchased. We had good flights and seats until Delta made changes. Delta offered an upgrade to first class for a fee of $25,000. That’s not even an option worth considering. It should not be the customers’ burden to bear nor hours of customer time to get an airline to correct their mistake.

They offered to put my wife on a 9:00 flight  Sunday morning. The problem being that she and I were leaving on Monday to go to scotland, both on fully paid fares on Delta. I was at home and found that there was an American airlines flight that left at 11:45 that night. Delta refused to put her on it. So, in my desperation, we paid $2,300 ourselves to get her back in time. As she waited in line for the  American airlines flight,.she talked to a man who had been on her canceled flight. Well, what do you know, Delta had paid to put him on that American flight.

I submitted a complaint through their website when she got back. Waited 6 weeks heard nothing. Tried to call and they are not taking calls about complaints. So, I emailed Ed Bastian, the CEO. Within a day I got an email from customer service saying they had my claim and we're still working on it. When they finally responded they said they do not refund money to customers from other airlines. But, they said that they gave my wife 17,500 skymiles, a $150 voucher, and would refund the part of her Delta trip that she did not take. The American ticket was $2,300. The refund will get will be about $350. Since Delta keeps jacking up SkyMiles requirements, 17500 miles is pretty irrelevant.

So, I emailed Mr. Bastian again. One of his flunkies responded to me that the 17,500 mi was not met to make up the camcelled flight. It was a gesture for how badly they felt.

Did I mention that I am a platinum medallion flyer and my wife is a silver medallion flyer. I don't think what I asked for is unreasonable, and I am completely disgusted by Delta's response.  Looks like you might have more luck getting what you want from them if you're a man.

At least times five in one conversation and of course I never got the same live person which meant each time I had to start the process all over again. it's very frustrating.

We were told the flight was delayed an hour. Then after waiting an hour the flight was loaded . Then Delta announces that the flight crew is over FAA regulations so they have to change crews. We deboard and wait four hours for a new flight crew from MInneapolis. 
We spoke to the Delta rep after waiting an hour in line and was told we could spend the night in LA and catch the original flight out the next day . They did offer to put us up in a hotel . 
After landing in LA we had to stand in line at the Delta help desk for almost an hour . The flights we were guaranteed for the next day we not booked and both flights were full. We were given our original flights for the next day . We waited 30 minutes for a bus to the hotel and finally got checked in around one am . 
Delta did give us some meal vouchers . 
We waited at Lax for seven hours the next day to catch our original flight which was late .

Old planes, atrocious boarding system, mayhem, trashy customer service, are the words that come mind.  I decided to give Delta one last chance during a 30 years anniversary trip to Athens.  What a mistake!!! Landed at my connecting flight location only to find out that it was delayed by two hours; enough to miss my connection from Athen to Santorini. Landed without my bag in Athens; had to spent hours (at 25 cents a minute) to locate my bag. After a full 24 hours because of my call and only then an attendant placed my luggage on a plane to Santorini.  Coming back was even worse!!!  Just as I was heading to the airport at 0300 AM I get a notification that my connecting flight from Rome to Atlanta was cancelled.  What we had to go thorough from that point on was just absolute madness. And then there was the newer American Airlines plane parked next to Deltas A330 (in service for 29 years!) and that cemented my new stance regarding Delta as the new post pandemic take your chance airline.","Nosedive; not the shadow of what it was in its heydays","false","false"

The first one was delayed a bit out of JFK because the captain was delayed so we boarded and waited for him to arrive.

The one back was on time.

I really like this plane A330-900neo. It is spanking new, reasonably quiet, the seats are wider than on 777 or 787 (the competing flight to TLV by United).

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"We paid for First Class tickets to fly to Lihue.  We were extremely disappointed in the service, the flight attendants and especially the “meal”.  

Delta is ripping First Class customers off (in my opinion).  On this lousy flight they gave us a stale, old sandwich, a tiny package of chips, and one cookie in a cardboard box.  No beverage. No wine, no juice, nothing.  

 Whatever happened to the nice white cloth on the tray table?  The real wineglasses? The wine? We are paying $$ for a FIRST class experience!  Not to be treated like a cow in a barn. 

The “meals” are a joke and a ripoff.  Cardboard can NOT be cleaned or sanitized.  It passes germs from person to person.  From the food service building - the people that load them - flight attendants- passengers.  

Real dishes can be washed AND sanitized.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"We flew from Asia to USA last June to July and booked Delta for interstate visits which is around 8 flights within our month stay.

Right at the time I landed USA the nightmare started where our connecting flight from LA to Las Vegas was cancelled. When I asked customer service the rep told me that our plane (affiliate airlines of Delta) arrived late, which I don't know why will that be significant when Delta's flight from LA to Las Vegas was clearly cancelled so doesn't matter if my flight arrived late. So then I went to customer service have to line up for almost 2 hours and next available flight where I only took the chance to board is at around 7pm while original flight is 12:30pm.

Next, Las Vegas to New York, we did online checkin and arrived 1.5 hours before flight and when we were trying to load our baggage self-service machine errored out and we were told to go to customer service which again took 1 hour and so we were not able to board. We were told next flight is next day by their rude customer service staff telling us that it is the best option he can give. So I tried to message customer service on mobile device and got flight same day but at around 9pm.

Next was from New York to Chicago. There was a long line at the airport security and one staff managing line changed the line from individual group's cord to one long stupid line that caused those who arrive first be just behind the ones who arrived last and those who arrived last are more than us who came in first. I was walking in line quite worried and tired from the long queue and then when I was in queue I moved on the side similar to how I got in so she can see me clearly since her booth is too small and this black arrogant security just rudely closed the door thinking I would proceed to go in when she clearly is holding my passport. And she even threatened to hurt me. I don't know why black lives matter when they discriminate Asians. Anyway, so ending is my friend and I got separated on the line and she got in last minute on boarding gate while I was still in this long queue with arrogant airport security. And again Delta staff told me they can't do anything and told me next flight is again next day. And since I already experienced same useless Delta customer service in Las Vegas I know that the way to get earliest possible flight is through mobile customer service. So I got on a night flight again on a different Chicago airport where my luggage is at another airport and have to pick it up there. NOTE: that same day there were senior citizens who were not allowed to board 4 times and lost their business class booking, and kids who were allowed to check in their luggage but not allowed to board because of some paperwork and one black customer service personnel which seems like their supervisor shouted at the kid which made her cry. The senior passengers advised the black supervisor to calm down because she is talking to a kid and that supervisor even shouted at the senior passengers telling them they don't know what's happening.

Next flights are on states where there are not much passengers so we were able to complete our flights with no issues.

But basing it from my experience with Delta where I should have just gone home and cut my vacation short if not for my friend who asked me to accompany her on the trip I will never go back to America. It seems like a land of rude people with Delta's poor customer service, while we were there to tour and spend cash for their dying economy.","Nightmare! Will never fly Delta again!","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Our family, my wife, daughter and I, booked to fly with Virgin Atlantic to New York (USA) economy premium because of their excellent reputation for service and value for money. 

However, although our flight to New York from Heathrow was with Virgin Atlantic, because they have a partnership deal with Delta Airlines, unfortunately our return flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) was to be with the latter.

As a treat before the flight home I purchased access to the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse operated by Plaza Premium at New York JFK airport for approximately £190.  The experience was first class and we highly recommend their lounge.  This treat however was to be ruined thanks to the complete lack of customers care by Delta Airlines.  

Our flight to London Heathrow from JFK was scheduled to leave at 20.00hrs, 1 September 2022 from Gate 26 B.  However, the Gate was then changed to B 34.  A short while after we arrived at Gate 34 B we were informed by the Delta Airlines staff that they ‘…had lost the aircraft’ we were due to fly home on due to congestion at JFK.  

Subsequently we were informed at different times during the evening that the flight continued to be delayed for various reasons.  However none of the reasons given by the Delta Airlines staff for the delays mentioned that the aircraft in question had a number of serious technical problems that needed fixing.

Eventually we took-off from JFK around 23:30hrs some three and a half hours late. However about an hour and a half into the flight the Captain informed us that there was continuing problem with the cabin air pressure that could not be rectified while flying.  And, as a consequence, he was returning the aircraft to JFK as a safety precaution.  Without a doubt the Captain took the correct action and should be commended.

On our return to JFK we were deplaned at about 02.30hrs, informed that we would be sent an email that would have QR code vouchers attached that could be used to purchase food, we were also given physical Delta Airline vouchers to pay for a taxi to take us to and from the hotel they had booked us into.  

However, Delta Airlines did not provide anyone to escort us or any other passengers through the complex darkened and deserted airport.  Nor was there a Delta Airlines member of staff at the taxi rank to help passengers find a taxi that would accept their vouchers – we were simply left to find our own way.  It was for most passengers, including ourselves, quite a worrisome experience.      

When we did eventually arrive at the hotel at 03:30hrs, after 30 minutes or so of fast driving in the dark, we had no idea where we were and then told we had to be out of the room by 13.00hrs that day or pay extra as the Delta Airlines voucher did not cover any extra time.  

The hotel Delta Airlines booked us into looked very cheap to say the least and the room we were allocated so basic it could have been modelled on a prison cell.  Moreover, as the hotel only had extremely limited catering facilities they were only able to offer breakfast between 07:00hrs and 10:00hrs.  Given we did not get to bed until after 04:00hrs we did not make it in time for breakfast. Therefore we had nothing to eat until arriving back at JFK later that day.

Moreover Delta Airlines decided not to deplane the luggage so we only had what was in our in-flight bags.  Hence, we did not have a change of clothes or toiletries which left us feeling very uncomfortable indeed.   

We arrived back at JFK the following day at around 13.00hrs.  On our arrival we went to the Delta Airlines Help Desk where much to our dismay we found a group of rude, arrogant and unhelpful Delta Airlines staff.  

In the first instance I showed them documentation that demonstrated we had purchased lounge access prior to our flight the night before.  We then asked that given Delta Airlines had cancelled our flight and we now had no lounge access could they arrange for us to use the Delta Airlines airport lounge.  This was so we would not be disadvantage by their cancellation of the flight.  Their reply was a very brusque no.  

Shortly afterwards we went to get something to eat and found that the e-mailed vouchers on our mobile phone would not be accepted at the food outlets that we tried.  Consequently, once again we went to the Delta Airlines Help Desk to ask for assistance.  

The Delta Airlines Help Desk staff were informed that the food outlets would not accept the QR code vouchers on our mobile phone but it then took a great deal of effort to get them to print off (hard copies) of the QR code vouchers we had been given.  However when the printed QR code vouchers were offered for payment at MacDonald’s they were also refused.  So we had to pay cash for our meal.  

Consequently we once again returned to the Delta Airlines Help desk.  After a great deal more effort and much arguing we eventually got the staff at the so called ‘Help Desk’ to issue physical vouchers similar to the ones which had been issued the previous night for our taxi journeys.  These were accepted by the food outlets we used.  As to why they did not issue these Delta Airline vouchers in the first place is a mystery and one they would not explain.  In addition they would not refund the money we paid for our meal even thought we had the receipt.      

It should also be noted that each of the Delta Airlines food vouchers had a face value of $15. However the vouchers could not be aggregated together, i.e. each voucher had to be used separately.  Consequently the total amount of food that could be purchased using each Delta Airlines voucher was to a maximum of $15.  It was not permitted to use two vouchers to pay for a meal of say $30.  Absolutely absurd given it was Delta Airlines who cancelled the flight because their aircraft was unserviceable.  

In addition, because we were travelling as a family I had reserved our seats on the aircraft in a straight line.  The two next to the window and the first seat on the other side of the aisle for myself.  Thus we would be sat together although separated by the aisle.  However on our return journey Delta Airlines, without asking permission, moved my seat reservation forward so we were no longer sat together as a family.  Thus from our experience Delta Airlines does not care in the least about their customers – just making money.  

Virgin Atlantic should not partner with Delta Airlines given their complete lack of customer care.  We are also aware that there were many other passengers on our return flight who felt the same way.

We will still fly with Virgin Atlantic but only provided that we do not have to complete any part of a journey using Delta Airlines.

Our connecting flight was delayed for an hour due to some problems in Atlanta airport— our plane arrived but couldn’t get to the gate as there was something blocking it. Delta staff said it’s showing on their system that our plane has arrived, but we didn’t show up, that’s why they’ve given away our FIRST CLASS seats to other people. When we first arrived at the boarding gate, they told my husband that the plane has already left. When I went over to the staff and asked what we should do, they didn’t bother answering me, not even a glance, until I let out my frustrations and got their attention. That’s when they “explained” that they have given away our seats. To cut the story short, they were able to let us board but downgraded 2 of our seats. We didn’t bother complaining anymore because it was already late at night and we had a toddler with us. Of course, we arrived in Memphis without our luggages and finished sorting things out (re luggages delivery) at almost 2 in the morning. 
We were very disappointed not because our seats were downgraded but because of how we were treated before boarding. Considering that we were all exhausted from running, trying to catch our flight. That was our third flight as a part of our travel from the UK.","Appalling “service”","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"We had tickets for my wife and I for a flight with Delta. I called Delta on way to airport to add on infant in lap. The representative I spoke with said she's going to add the infant and put me on hold. I was still on hold when I arrived to airport at, so when I went to check-in, I told the woman there that I'm currently on hold with Delta to add the infant, and she said she can do it there. I still waited on hold just in case, and after a few minutes, asked the woman if she had added infant and she said yes. I therefore hung up from the call (it had been already 40 minutes on hold by that time), as I was told that the infant had been added already. A few minutes later we still had not received our booking tickets, so I asked what was going on, and she told that she has to call over supervisor to add the baby on. This was after I was told that the infant is already on. We waited another half hour, and than I asked supervisor (Name tag:......) what's happening, he said there's some issue with him doing it on the computer and he'll have to call the service center in US. After him waiting on hold for an extremely long time (a supervisor not being able to contact own company for 45 minutes...hmm), I told him it's about 45 minutes to flight departure, and he said it will be fine, there's more time. This happened every few minutes. I asked him if there are empty seats on the plane, and he confirmed that there are, but insisted on not giving the infant a ticket for a full seat, even though there were empty ones, which would have solved everything. Every time I asked him, he said there's more than enough time, it will be fine. We were with a baby who had a soiled diaper, wife sitting on floor for an hour, and guy keeps saying there's more time till takeoff, it will be fine.  Meanwhile, I called Delta myself, and spoke with a supervisor who said he would add her on. After a few minutes, the call got disconnected (I will give the benefit of the doubt that this was not intentional, but either way, I was not given a call-back, even though the supervisor knew what an issue was going on, and the incompetence of workers at the Delta counter). At around 2:15 (half hour to takeoff), I went to ask the supervisor what's going on, and he said it's been taken care of, and it will be another few minutes. At 2:20 he brings us to security desk to boarding, still without a ticket for our infant. At 2:25, we get to the boarding door, still without ticket.
Instead of apologizing profusely, immediately after we arrived to boarding gate, before we even uttered a word (no room for any excuses of ""customer was aggressive, and this was in response"" etc., the manager Ms. .....  .......... comes over and says ""we're trying to get you on flight and we''ll give you another 5 minutes, otherwise we will rebook you tomorrow"". Will give us another 5 minutes??! Unbelievable. Just like that, making it sound like we are the ones with an issue, and will ""give us"" another 5 minutes, when it was one incompetent worker after the next that caused the issue. After 5 minutes, she came back and said she's rebooking us for next day. Unbelievable. Two employees there actually turned around their name badges so as not to let me see their names. Manager ..... ......... than told me that it was our fault that we don't have ticket for the infant. When I told her that the reason I don't have one is because I hung up from waiting on hold with someone from Delta who was adding her on, because the woman at the check-in counter confirmed that she had already added her, her response was ""she couldn't have added her because there's no ticket for the infant"". Unbelievable. I'm in middle of telling her that one of her employees had erred, which caused us to not have ticket, and instead of apologizing and saying that she'd investigate and compensate, she in essence tells me that I'm lying because there's no ticket made for the infant! After that, she tells me that her job is done; she just has to rebook me on next flight and she does not want to discuss anything (way to go Delta- some service!! Now I understand why when I looked up Delta reviews, I see 1.8/5 on Trustpilot... because although mistakes can happen anywhere, when after-the-fact you're told by the managers that they don't wan't discuss anything about what happened, that's when you know we're talking about a different type of service- not just better or worse, but a different league... In this light, a 1.8/5 rating is not surprising...). All throughout, she was making it sound as if we were the ones with the issue, and that they were doing us a favor for waiting on hold the whole time with US Delta. 
After seeing what Delta Airlines service is like, I started recording the conversation to be available. At which point she told me it's illegal. That's an outright lie. As a matter of fact, thankfully there were 2 police officers whom were called over, and I asked them if it's legal, to which they answered  that it's 100 percent legal. As I was told by the other manager ""shut the F---- up""... it was a good thing we had those police called over... Unbelievably, while these Delta managers and staff were busy trying to make it sound as if it was our issue and not theirs - somehow thinking that by trying that route the story would magically change (go figure), and that they don't wan't to discuss anything, these local Police officers were actually the ones whom were extremely apologetic the entire time, apologizing throughout, and stayed with us long after these Delta employees left to make someone else's day miserable, and did not leave us until we had every single one our luggage back, the entire time apologizing profusely for what happened. 
After contacting Delta, they replied that they are ""glad"" to offer some petty Gift Cards to other retailers... seemingly, this service is no surprise to them...

A couple of hours before the departure time, our flights got cancelled and there was no rescheduling possibility for that day.

My Airbnb accommodations had to be canceled without a reimbursement unless there was an extenuating circumstance. I called Delta on multiple occasions asking them to email me a letter stating that flights had been canceled without a possibility to reschedule that day and they did not email me the letter.

I began making calls to Delta to change our flight home as soon as possible. We realized that the change in our return flight would cost $1,000...almost as much as our initial roundtrip flight. 

I told the specialist that I needed to talk to my girlfriend about the costs to see what was possible for us. The specialist was understanding and calm in an intense situation and gave me clear instructions on how to contact him should I call back once we knew we were able to pay that amount.

I called back to schedule our flight fully prepared to pay the $1,000. He then told me that he would not be charging us for the change. During the quiet moments of our call, he asked how her son was doing and expressed his heartfelt wishes.

I cannot stress enough the value of being shown such kindness in a situation like this from a corporate entity. My phone service was spotty and I didn't quite catch his name - he was out of the Dallas office...possibly Sisbelle.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Kiwi.com and Delta Airlines are truly a match made in customer-care purgatory! Sooooo uhhhh…Hi there! My name is Susan, originally from New Zealand.
Sorry for the abrasion, but my small talk currently just Kamikaze-jumped headfirst out the 8th story of my Seoul, S. Korea 3-day layover. A layover I never required, much less a layover outta MY pocket with days of expenses to be incurred here, but this is how manic & irrational some airlines are with this Pandemic. I’ve never seen such wild inefficiency, since perhaps 9/11. 
This is a story about how a 39 hour journey from the Western continental Americas, sadly, became a 5 day trip, chock-full of obscure flights, lost suitcases, international airports on graveyard shift, and crap food to hold me over while I slowly worked my way back to the Eastern hemisphere of Indonesia. My home away from home for decades, equipped with children and a career I need to return to with some semblance of a plan…  however, that plan is being obliterated by Kiwi.com/ Delta Airlines as I speak! I’m sitting here, 10 kilometers from Incheon airport, where I shall sit until the first flight to Bali that has a seat available, is willing to transport me. 

This is all Delta’s doing at the moment, and I cannot believe my own story as I sit back and revel in it while typing. Kiwi.com, however, as a travel agent, is rather complicit in my defenseless position. Why, you ask?
I’d be happy to tell you my itinerary was put together by Kiwi.com, with a seemingly flawless algorithm, until I realized that this itinerary relies on every facet of transfers, Covid testing, and airline employees executing their job duties in a timely, effective manner. When this chain is disrupted by merely one weak link working for Delta Airlines, I became occupational hazard in the flesh… missing flights, having to pay unreal sums of money because we have flight stewards who aren’t attuned to my needs. Okay, so I know this is a little cryptic, as it has been for me in real time here in Seoul Incheon International Airport. 
I started July 26th, 2022 with a flight from Austin, Texas, USA scheduled to 8pm… From there to go on to Houston, TX with an 11 hour layover before boarding my Seoul, S. Korea flight, and ultimately from S. Korea to Bali, Indonesia. Home Sweet Home!

My first July 26th flight from Austin to Houston was canceled and rescheduled for the following morning - requiring my 2nd flight from Houston to Atlanta (where I would make my connection to Seoul and onwards home to Bali) to be delayed. This was flight DL1315.
I had downloaded the Kiwi.com App as recommended to receive updates and none of this information was posted there. Kiwi.coms’ app was actually such a joke, that my google profile became the de facto OS for me, alerting me to flight delays and suggesting nearby hotels.
First off, I am a foreign national in Indonesia, and my passport and visa paperwork clearly show this. However, the woman at the Delta boarding gate in Houston insisted her computer was not up to date on the half a dozen different visas Indonesia gives its ex-pats, and that I could only enter as a tourist. “Fine” I say, “enter me as a tourist.”
But a tourist must show an outbound international flight to enter Indonesia. Naturally, as a permanent resident of Indonesia, I had booked a 1-way ticket home to Bali. Despite all my pleas and .gov info from Indonesia Customs online, Delta would not allow me to board the seat I paid for until I ordered an outbound ticket from Indonesia… So I ordered one, right on the spot, for a couple of hundred dollars, and just barely made my flight out of Houston. 
Okay, off to Atlanta, and to catch my Korean Air flight on time.
I was concerned about making my connection in Atlanta, and considered purchasing an additional flight to arrive at the correct time in Atlanta, but as Kiwi.com require passengers to board all flights booked or risk the remaining flights not being honored, I had no choice but to get on the flight I had been assigned. 
That DL1315 flight landed in Atlanta at the same time the flight to Seoul was scheduling to take off. 
I ran and ran hoping for a delay but arrived to an empty gate in Atlanta. My Korean Air flight (Operated by Delta, mind you) had gone. This is now the 2nd flight in the chain that I wasn’t able to board on time. Flight DL7850.
One Delta staff lady there was extremely kind and helpful and I received a complimentary night in a nearby hotel with food vouchers. I would get back on my flight the next day. Unfortunately this is also where the real problem began. 
Delta could only rebook the Seoul to Bali leg of my journey for 3 days ahead later than my initial arrival date. I would be in Seoul for 3 days at my own expense. Korean airlines would not take any responsibility as they had not made any errors - saying it was Delta’s responsibility, and my tickets did indeed say Delta was the handler of Korean Airlines. ALL the flight numbers started with “DL” , which is Delta. 
Essentially, as soon as I boarded that flight in Atlanta to Seoul I was no longer Deltas' responsibility, and that I should appeal to Korean Airlines from there on out. Okay, so far I’ve only lost a couple of hundred dollars on , and that was much less bothersome than the thousand dollars in lost wages and the financial struggles of finding an additional 3 days childcare in Bali where my kids were awaiting my return.
And so began 3 days of being bounced back and forth trying to get home to my children, my clients, and the Hormones that a 51 year old woman must stabilize for harmonious, day-to-day life.  I repeatedly pointed out to Delta and Korean Air staff that my official printed itinerary showed Delta as the operating Airline on all flights, but they continued to deny the ability to help me, saying that authority to change me to an earlier flight would have to come from Kiwi.com., who, by the way, don’t have any real Customer service line, nor a functional way to assist their customers in such urgent situations. 
Their automated help line is not helpful. Their redirection to a flight expert service that promises a real human (at an annual price… NO JOKE) is only available if you have a phone number that begins (+1). I messaged repeatedly asking for a solution to this and got the same robot generated reply. 
And the really fun part? Get this: When my flight in Atlanta landed late that day, and my original Korean flight left on time without me, my luggage actually got transferred to the plane I missed! So yes, now I have no idea when I get another flight out of Atlanta, and I also have 0 clean clothes or hygiene while in limbo. I mistakenly thought I had seen the worst of this trip at this point. 
Now because I was never designed to be a Korean tourist for 3 days, and instead should have only been in Korea on transit layover, Bali-bound… there was a few curveballs much like the Houston experience where I had to order a separate departure from Bali in order for Delta to even allow me to board. So it went like this: after my sleepover in Atlanta due to my Seoul flight leaving me, I awoke and headed straight to the airport 3 hours early to catch my NEW Seoul flight… I wanted to be prepared for whatever came my way, seeing as how this trip had already been pretty eventful in all the wrong ways.
So it started with me approaching the Delta counter with one heck of a story and my boarding pass. Little did it matter however, as I was promptly told I could not board the plane to Seoul without a negative Covid test… this research I had already done and saw no guideline about needing a negative test so long as I’m double vaxxed. Apparently now that I’m gonna be a tourist of Korea for 3 unwanted days, I need a rapid test. And of course, there are no testing facilities in the Atlanta airport, so I get to pay for a return trip taxi to get me to the nearest testing facility and back. Awesome, there goes another couple of hundred dollars!
So I return to Delta gate, thinking that as much as this company seems to want to keep me from boarding this flight I paid for, I’m golden now and I will absolutely be on my way and HEY, just maybe, just maybe my luggage will even be there in S.Korea waiting for me. Oh, but wait: fail again! Now I’m being told I cannot board the plane without first applying for a Korean E-visa. 
And for whatever reason, the ticket clerk who informed me I’d need to go buy a Covid test before permission to board Delta flight operated by Korean Air DL7850, for whatever reason she did not tell me about this stipulation at the same time I was taxiing off to the testing center. I could’ve done this in the taxi on the way to the testing center and gotten the approval before I even returned to Atlanta Airport with my negative test results.
So I can hardly believe my ears when she tells me I’ll have to apply for this E visa first, and this is where I just began bawling because it became painfully clear to me that the same staff who I’ve paid to get me home to Bali on their plane , is actually the  same staff that are doing everything they can to STOP me from boarding that plane. By the time I pulled my composure together and finished the Korean E visa application, boarding has already begun and I had yet to receive email confirmation of my E visa.
So yes! I also missed this flight and was looking at another day in USA, when a really helpful Delta employee who had borne witness to my perpetuating disaster, offered me a plane to New York where I could catch another Seoul S. Korea flight that night, versus staying another night in Atlanta. This would NOT be my flight scheduled for the 27th, DL7872. In fact, I wasn’t
a passenger on any of the three flight numbers I paid to commute on. Every single flight I boarded was an alternative flight number.
As it stood, I was busy emailing Kiwi.com and after more than 24 hours received an email asking me if my problem had been resolved yet. What a cop out!! That email was utterly useless. No information, no next step, just a giant loop back to a service I can’t use due to not having a phone number starting in (+1). Shocking, to say the least.
In any case, I accepted the New York flight to catch Korean flight Seoul, and equipped with a negative test and E-visa which had been confirmed via email just after the Atlanta flight for Korea left, I was finally able to board. In fact, once I no longer had to deal with the Delta Stewards, things began rolling along. Of course, I was still paying out of pocket for all these new accommodations I never wanted, but at least I now had some flight attendants who believed in providing transport for their paying clientele and were happy to help me retrieve my luggage and secure a guesthouse in Seoul. I realize that just sounds like the job description of an airline attendant, but after being mercilessly rejected transportation by Delta employees, I was actually beginning to question what the objective actually is for passengers on Delta. It seemed to me like, come hell or high water, Delta was NOT going to allow me to fly with them. I was in such despair until some friendly Celestial faces in Seoul insisted that they would get me home to Bali on the 31st of July.
I started this journey on the 26th of July, before Delta flight delays, before Delta obstinately refused my Foreign National visa status of Indonesia and made my buy a ticket out of Indonesia that I’ll never use, before surprising me with a negative test requirement that NOBODY else asked me for throughout this debacle, before burning my efficiency clock out with a E-visa mandate that wasn’t confirmed quick enough———I’ve never felt so unwanted on a carrier craft in all my days! And Kiwi.com is every bit as negligent, I must say.
Honestly, I never had another problem once I got out of Delta Airlines clutches, but as I sit here in a not-so-cheap Korean guesthouse with my Korean groceries and Korean SIM card and Korean taxi I need to get anywhere from this location I’m in, I’m tallying up what Delta cost me in mental anguish as well as the out of pocket losses I’m enduring, and I’m short about $2400 usd and 3 days thanks to piss-poor service.
I definitely intend on sharing my truth with anyone using Delta: Be prepared for petty problems, as I’m also reading recent 2022 reviews of others who received the same treatment with Delta, because it appears that a once-great airline has lost its edge. 
And as far as Kiwi.com is concerned, I don’t think they’ve ever been champion customer care practitioners, but this is bound to be a new low for them as well: Paying $30-60usd for access to a live representative when help is needed is beyond just helping make ends meet for the company. It’s modern-day fleecing your clientele, and rest assured I will be broadcasting my nightmare international charter with every rating platform who will listen. I’m THAT disappointed. Shame on you 2 companies. Just cuz ya’ll deserve one another, doesn’t mean you 2 deserve clients as well.

To start with, my seat was occupied by a lady who claimed she ""had been told to seat there""and would not bulge. The flights attendants were not helpful and it took 20 mn. to finally get our seats. Then came the meals: there was no menu listed on the Delta website, no indication that we could chose a wine other than red or white, and a meal handed with minimum effort. The taste was OK but there was not much to eat. The afternoon snack was another surprise: choice between hamburger or salad. I chose the salad and used the sauce provided with it: a Japanese-style seasoning (soy, monosodium glutamate?)with something that triggered an immediate allergic reaction. (This is why a menu should be given ahead of time with a list of ingredients). The staff could not have cared less. On request, I was given a glass of bubbling water and napkins. I got very scared.

Well, over the course of this year, the fine folks decided that we needed to stop at Atlanta to swap planes. First, the flight crews were all super, on both legs of the trip down and back up . Second, we never would book trips through JFK unless it was nonstop because JFK is a total pain in the rump. So, a really early flt out of JFK to Atl, had to walk the entire concourse to get to the gate. Not good for someone with back and leg issues. Next, land in Atl only to have to walk the entire concourse from one end to the other, catch the air train to another concourse and walk the whole length to get to the gate. By the time we arrived in St Thomas, this kids body was beat down like a boxing dummy. The return trip was even worse. WE arrived in Atl with only half an hour to go from one concourse (f) to concourse A. Thankfully there were about 40 others onboard so they made sure our connecting flight was there waiting for us. Just stinks that they have such close times with different planes on different ends of the airport. UGH!!! Oh, the arrival into JFK was a hard landing.

Almost everyone with connecitiong flights on this flight missed their connections. My itinerary said it would arrive at 7:31 PM and leave at 9:55 PM. When I got to Seattle my plane landed at the top on S gate and I had to go to gate B3 and I had 10 minutes to get there. I quickly walked down one corridor to another corridor to the escalators to the train..took 2 escalators got on the train to B and went up another escalator then down two corridors way to the end and the flight had just closed it's doors. I practically ran all the way down those two corridors I have asthma and had to use my inhaler before I passed out. I went to the help desk. They put me on a later flight with several other Boise people that were on my flight 3553 that missed their same flight. One lady was connecting to Phoenix and had two children. She missed her Phoenix flight and had to stay overnight in Seattle. You cannot get from the S gate to the B gate in 10 minutes.I only had a computer bag to carry the others had more luggage. Then the later flight was delayed twice while we were waiting for it. Our boarding pass and the agent that rebooked us all told us to go to gate A2 which we all did. The agent at gate A2 said it was the Medford Oregon gate and that we must have the wrong gate although our boarding passes said gate A2. Finally the plane arrived at 11:55 and we got on I got to Boise at 2:30 in the morning on Saturday morning. I left Eugene Oregon at 5:45 Friday afternoon. Then my granddaughter who was picking me up (she has 4 small children at home) was waiting all this time for me. Well my luggage was checked so it went with the first plane and when we got to Boise it was not there. We had to hunt down someone to find it in the luggage room. I got home around 3:30 AM. I do have to give kudos to one kind man agent that noticed my breathing distress and gave me a couple of small bottles of water and had me sit down and brought my boarding pass to me. He even bumped me up to comfort class which was really nice since the long wait I endured.
I am 73 years old, I have asthma, I just lost my husband of 19 years in May. I needed to go to Oregon to visit my daughter. I like to visit her when I can and most of the time it is okay.

I will fly because they can't leave their farm for any length of time and it is easier for mom to fly out to them, but I will ask her to use a different airlines next time. My customer service agent was a nice man but the other agent told the lady with two children she should have been able to make it. With two children in tow and luggage she could not make it across the airport that fast.
The Boise flight had to know there were at least 5 people or more missing from their boarding.

My wife asked me to see if I could get an earlier flight home (7/28/22) and there were seats available on a 5:40am flight including first class.

The Delta App showed my change fee as over $2200.

After 3 attempts, I reached Lisa in customer service who said if I was willing to go Delta Comfort, they would only charge me $1100.   Are you kidding me?!?!?  Asked if I could go standby, I was also told no.  (At this point I am fuming!!!)

She explained that the prices of the seats have gone up since I purchased.   ""Well so has the price on the seat of the later flight I am giving up,"" I replied!

My thought is if I hold a First class, fully refundable ticket and their is a similar seat available, it should be an even switch.   I found a 1st class on United for $550 (also last minute) connecting through Dulles and purchased that instead and cancelled my Delta flight.  Lisa told me the Delta cancellation would be a roughly $750 credit, but when I cancelled through the Delta App, my refund was $589.

As a CEO, I have never been as angry and upset at an airline.   From this point forward I have disallowed all travel on Delta at our company.

We do our very best to book our flights with Delta , have for many years, and generally have good results for domestic flights. We like Flying Delta.  We have always thought we could depend on Delta for good and safe service.  However during our last 2 international flights, one in October 2019, just before COVID, and then again July 5th, 2022,  with Delta , we experienced last minute “ already at the gate and too far away to go back home” flight cancellations.  In 2019, we were returning from 2 weeks in a Italy with the cancellation in Rome due to mechanical issues.  It was understandable, however, a difficult next 24 hrs . DELTA  compensated us with several vouchers and some sky miles and ONLY because of European Laws which we found out about, but not thru Delta, did they also reimburse us an amount of several hundred euros per ticket.  They also provided buses to take us to a designated hotel . By the end of the evening, including waiting in line for a bus and then in line with several hundred others to be checked into the hotel that evening and next morning , we stood in line for 6-7 hours before finally being rebooked the next day, losing our Delta Comfort seats and finally arriving home a grueling day later.  We survived that ordeal, NEVER DREAMING IT could happen to us again.  We were satisfied with our compensation.

SURPRISE! FAST FORWARD TO JULY 2022.    As we are waiting to board our 9:10pm flight from Detroit to Amsterdam and on to Bordeaux to begin our 2 week visit to Bordeaux and other areas of SW France on July 5th, 2022, there comes an announcement that our flight is being “ delayed” for mechanical issues.  2 hours later we finally get the word that our flight that evening is CANCELLED!   How could we be so unlucky for this to happen to us on both of our last 2 international flights with Delta???  We had to wait until the next day to leave and again lost our bulkhead row Comfort seats.  We were able to keep Delta Comfort.

All of this being said, I appreciate the fact that Delta catches the mechanical issues before we leave the ground .  Safety is the most important thing.  However, I am disappointed that Delta cannot maintenance their flights more consistently ongoing and catch these major “  unflyable”  “ issues before we all plan our trips and get to the gate, or have another plane on standby for emergencies subs this. . I feel I can risk sounding ungrateful since this has happened to me 2 times in a row.

I was especially disappointed this time, because this delay in arriving at our destination robbed us of that time in the Bordeaux area, which was A VERY important part of our ONCE IN A LIFETIME trip to that area.  We paid a steep price for Delta Comfort Plus tickets to specifically get to Bordeaux , lost our bulkhead row seats,  and then We basically,y got to spend no time at all in The Bordeaux area.  By the time, we got there, we had to move on the next part of our itinerary- missing Bordeaux/ cancelling tours, etc- without our luggage, which by the way also got lost.  To Delta’s, credit, our luggage did finally chase us down 3 days later in another part of SWFrance.  

At this time, I believe 17,500 sky miles have been deposited into each of my husband and my accounts for our “ inconvenience”. Just a drop in the bucket of what is required to purchase another ticket to Bordeaux from my location.  Frankly, I feel that the 17,500 sky miles is an insult considering how much in cash I paid for the original ticket to Bordeaux  and the inconveniences we faced.  

As I said at the beginning of this lengthy critique, we have been loyal Delta customers for many years, but now I’m wondering if I can ever rely on Delta’s loyalty again.  We would like to fly internationally again , but I am really wondering if I can rely on Delta to get me there and not interrupt my carefully planned vacation schedule.  I appreciate that Delta takes safety seriously, but I do not think Delta takes the inconvenience of their loyal customers seriously.  How could this happen to the same 2 people  2 times in a row? Will it happen a 3rd time?  I’m “ gun shy” now!","Another disappointing International flight cancellation","false","false"

It was on the conveyor belt coming out of plane and the young lady was trying to get it off it it fell off convey belt onto her.  Yes she was hurt severely.  My question is why do you want us to fill out the form if no one will take the tone to read it. Delta will probably have to replace it. But all they could say was sorry and that I had to understand that there worker was hurt handling my chair.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"This is a follow up to my previous post where I arrived at Vancouver airport 3.5 hours prior to my flight, queued for over an hour to checkin and was then, and only then, told my flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on a new flight 7:30 next morning. I asked about a hotel and WestJet (Delta Partner)  said I needed to talk to Delta as I booked through them. Called Delta, for the umpteenth time lately, they said “nothing we can do because it’s a west jet flight”. Booked my own hotel, got back to airport at 5:45 am to checkin for my 7:30 flight. 1 person checking people in, averaging 10-12 minutes a person as they were rebooking many. Eventually called several of us out of the line who were booked on the 7:30 flight and said they could not get us to the gate on time. I am now re-scheduled on a 1:30 pm flight getting me back 2am Sunday morning. I am only on standby for that. 

Oh, and yesterday evening when I was told I needed to speak to Delta about hotel, food allowance etc there was not a single Delta person at their checkin desks (I have photos of yesterday and this morning as proof). So far it has cost me a hotel, breakfast and shall cost other meals and Ubers for my daughter to get to a presentation I was supposed to take her to, and for me to get home from the airport in Fl ‘if’ I get in at 2am tomorrow. 

All Delta staff used to be great and helpful. Now it’s 50/50. Some have been really helpful, albeit there is little they can do, others have a real attitude and are rude. That never, ever used to be the case.

The ‘it’s because of Covid’ standard excuse was used when asked why only 1 person was working at checkin. I asked how long before my 1:30 pm flight should I get in line to checkin in again if that was the case. I was told “it won’t be a problem later because we have a lot of people working then”. 

I guess they have a deluge of staff imminently recovering from Covid!

I was, on one of those calls, very clearly lied to, reported that and heard nothing back. 

I have now had an issue with my return flight. I started trying to contact Delta at about 11:30 pm, I was left on hold for 27 minutes, got disconnected. I called back, eventually started speaking to a very helpful lady several minutes later, explained the issue and she went off to check with WestJet to sort the issue out. I got disconnected again. I waited assuming I would get a call back, I didn’t. I called for a third time and the lady Sue’ who eventually answered the call presented me with a ‘nothing we can do just turn up at the airport tomorrow night and speak to WestJet ‘ attitude. I then spoke to Don a ‘supervisor’ from Dallas who had an equally low to zero interest in assisting me telling me that, although I booked my entire flight with Delta, there was nothing Delta could do as it is a WestJet flight. I explained that I booked through Delta and it’s not my responsibility who they partner with. I also explained that the First Lady was contacting WestJet to see why it wouldn’t let me check in and was telling me that I had ‘outstanding fees’ to pay. My flight was of course fully booked and paid for via Delta

I now have to arrive at the airport tomorrow, possibly be met with additional fees for some unknown reason, and take whatever seat I’m given for the long flight to Toronto. Don, the ‘supervisor from Dallas’ apparently thinks you can’t book in on a WestJet flight online, you always have to arrive at the airport.

Finally, after gritting my teeth by his rudeness, he quoted me a rate which was triple the cost of the tickets found online on the DELTA website. When asked why the rate was substantially higher than what I was looking at online, he said ""those tickets are sold out"". The tickets are not sold out, you are booking me this exact flight...the only reason why I am booking over the phone is because I cannot book minors online. He just kept repeating himself, ""it's sold out, you cannot have those tickets for that, it won't let you book them online if you tried"" ZERO sense considering the flight number, date, and time were all EXACTLY the same.

I booked a round trip flight from Salt Lake City to DC which had a lay-over in Raleigh. A few days before I left for the trip my itinerary where I was going changed and it made more sense for me to get off in Raleigh than in DC on my first flight. I thought nothing off this-I had already paid Delta for the flight-why would they care if I simply did not go on the second flight? 

When I went to return I went to the DC airport and tried to check-in only to find out that I did not have a ticket. I went to the customer service desk and after 45 minutes of waiting for the agent to get someone who could help me with my ""unique problem"" I was told that because I did not go on my second flight of my inbound trip by return trip had been cancelled. At this point I am close to not making the flight even if I manage to get a ticket because it took them so long to serve me. At first they told me I would not be able to fly back until the next day and then the agent found a seat for me for the extortionary price of 647$. I knew the price would not be better the next day so I took it-ran through the airport injuring my knee and only made it onto the flight in time due to the kindness of strangers.

I was told the reason they cancelled the rest of my itinerary was because ""I might take the low fare from the bundle deal and then find a cheaper second flight"". This makes absolutely no sense. Delta was paid for the flight-the only repercussion they suffered was that I was not on the next flight-seems really like a bonus. Then they obviously sold my next ticket, DID NOT SEND ME ANY NOTIFICATION THAT THEY HAD CANCELLED MY ITINERARY so that I was blind-sided at the airport and charged me an absolutely obscene amount for a 1-way ticket because they could given my desperation. This is horrible customer service which Delta supposedly prides themselves on. Reading the fine print now I know this is the policy but it's a policy that logically makes no sense so that most people would not think of it and Delta gets to not only make the price of my ticket, the price of selling my ticket again but then the price of selling me a ticket on the spot at 3x the price.

When we finally took off the food was served around 12 am. I should explain that I'm not a picky person, and I don't expect the food on the plain to be really yummy, but what was serviced WAS NOT EDIBLE!!! It looked absolutely disgusting, smelled awful, no salad (or just veggies), no desert was served at all. The person who is in charge of this food part of the flight should be eating this every day. How can you serve this to people on over 8 hours international flight??? It's a total shame. Breakfast ""sandwich"" was the same awful, the rats in NYC wouldn't eat it.

I explained I was told to inquire with her office and I had my baggage claim ticket. She snatached it/ripped it out of my hand and stormed over to the computer then told me my baggage should be on the flight I was on that day.

My wife and I are traveling over the 4th to celebrate our 7th anniversary in Key West.  I had some extra vacation to burn so I decided to spend a couple days with friends in Charleston.  We live in DC so I drove to Charleston and my flight to Key West originated from Charleston while my wife’s originated from Washington DC.  

This nightmare saga begins when I went to check my luggage in Key West in the early hours of Friday, 30 Jun.  The Key West gate agent informed me that my connecting flight from Atlanta to Key West (DL 2407) was cancelled due to weather damage to the aircraft windshield.  The only option they provided at that time was to shell out an additional $1200 for a first class seat on American Airlines which I simply cannot afford.  Note, to enhance our vacation, we had non-refundable reservations at the Gardens Hotel to the tune of $450ish per night.  So my twin options are to pay out $1200 to get there on the 30th or eat the resort fees which just plain sucks.  To add insult, the station manager treated me as if I should be grateful for effort they put in to find a flight on American which was nothing more than a 25 foot walk to the American desk and a simple query to the agent.  Yea…I’m not buying what she’s selling!!  The only shining light is that it looked like my wife was on track to make it to key west since she was on a later flight out of Atlanta.  
After an hour of looking at options like flying to Miami and taking a 3-hr Uber or trying to catch the FT Myer ferry, I reluctantly decided to fly to Atlanta, accept a hotel voucher for Friday night and take the earliest flight out on Saturday morning.
I made it to ATL, picked up my hotel voucher, kissed my wife goodbye and watched her board her flight (2-hrs delayed) to Key West and thought, at least the hotel reservation was not lost.
I stayed at a local Marriott and headed out at 6am on Saturday which was plenty of time to get through Security, grab a coffee, and get to the gate. 

ALAS…this black cloud of delayed and cancelled delta flights is not done with me:-(. I walk up to the gate only to find that my rescheduled flight (DL 2193) is delayed for mechanical issues.  Feeling defeated, I walk up to the help desk and the delta red coat confirms the flight delay and offers to place me as the 1st standby on the next flight (DL 2407) to Key West.  I’d like to draw your attention to the fact that the tail number of the flight that Im sitting standby is 2407 which is also the same flight that was weather damaged on 01 July and subsequently cancelled.  I’m standby on the same darn aircraft that should have taken me to Key West yesterday.

I’m now sitting in the Delta lounge and only time will tell if I get to Key West to celebrate my anniversary. 
My moneys on another cancelled flight and instead of telling us the flights cancelled because it’s not profitable…they’ll drum up some garbage excuse like mechanical issues

This company is as much of a train wreck as the Biden administration.  Nothing but problems and no feasible solutions!  Oh…and the CEO can shove that empty apology right up a dark hole because this company is doing nothing more than deferring the pain and frustration of terrible corporate decisions to the  customers.

While I arrived at JFK from Europe on time and while JFK Passport Control was easy with little wait (I use Global Entry) and while customs was easy and I arrived on  time, DL 1660 was cancelled.  

DL rebooked me for a 30 June 2022, and upgraded me to 1st class.  This info was available to me through my smart phone app.  What I didn't know was I had to wait in rebooking line so DL could retag and take my checked luggage AND provide hotel and meal compensation (which they did).  Had DL notified me by email or app that I needed to wait in rebooking line to collect vouchers and instructions, this would have made all the difference.

Sandra at JFK DL Rebooking was very helpful, unfortunately she had a large line of passengers due to multiple DL flight cancellations.  Remember to be polite to DL airport staff, it isn't their fault.

Finally, there is a BIG difference in airline service from domestic to international.  Domestic service is generally poor, loud, obnoxious.  international flights are always so much better.  Don't know why this is the case.  It maybe many Americans flying domestic are rude and nasty and international travels are not.  Not exactly sure, but international travel is always easier.

Moreover, international airlines like Qatar, Emirates, Lufthansa, KLM are always awesome.  3rd class coach service on many foreign airlines is better than US 1st class.  I mean you get fine china, towel service before and after dinner on most international airlines.  Not on domestic carriers in the US you don't.

So, what can I say? Flight DL20 departed from Seattle on time. Crew members were pretty friendly and started serving dinner very quickly. I was sitting next to the emergency exit so no complaints about legroom at all. Arrival to London was ahead of schedule. The only negative moment I would like to mention is that the Airbus A-330-300 was quite outdated.

Due to thousands of flights being cancelled and/or delayed yesterday, I called Delta last night to find out what would happen if my boys were stranded in Atlanta. The wait time to talk to a Delta rep on the phone was 1.5 hours so I opted to text message one instead. This was actually easy and convenient and the agent seemed very helpful, assured me that my oldest son (19) was old enough to use a hotel voucher if they became stranded. Well they DID get stranded because their first flight was delayed an hour. Instead of waiting for passengers that Delta surely would be able to tell were coming from late planes, their second plane pulled out of the terminal as my boys were running to the gate to catch it. there were NO Delta representatives at the gate anymore and it took them quite some time to find an agent who would speak to them. This agent was rude to them, and refused to speak to my husband (their dad) on the phone while they were trying to figure out what to do. Because we were unable to speak to this agent, and the wait time to speak to an agent on the phone was long again, I texted another representative who told me they could not issue a meal voucher or a hotel voucher and that I would have to talk to a red coat agent at the airport. I was told there was no phone number to call a red coat agent, and when I asked if there were still any at the airport at midnight, I was told that the boys could talk to any agent. Well they already tried that and were told to sleep in the airport. So right now at 1am local time, my two teen age sons are wandering around the Atlanta airport waiting for an 8:30 am flight. Delta should be able to hold final-leg flights a few minutes for customers coming from delayed connecting flights. In this day and age it should be EASY to see those customers.

Easily the worst flight dinner I’ve ever received and I’ve done a lot of international travel. And they were stingy with drinks even though this was almost a 9 hour international flight—for example, would not give the can of Coke, just a glass. As a result of the torturous journey to Italy, decided to upgrade on the way back. My mother and I were on the same reservation and it showed three seats left in premium select. She used miles to upgrade me to one of those seats, and then went to do it herself—nope!! Wouldn’t let her even though two seats were still shown as available. So now I’m still in an economy seat and she’s in premium. Wasted hours on website trying to figure out what happened and logging in later to see if that changed anything. Then called delta but of course it’s a two hour wait for a human. Tried the online chat. After 40 mins of waiting some lady finally replied saying that if there are only two seats left in that class, then they no longer allow upgrades but she can “rebook” my ticket if my mom wants to pay $575. Won’t let her use any miles whatsoever, told her we’d be willing to pay some cash but was told nothing she can do. Asked to speak to someone higher hoping they would have some override power. That person was even less helpful. Could provide no reasons for why there could not be an override or why it was necessary to keep those two seats free from upgrades. Said they were not promised to anyone so it’s not as if Delta was guaranteed full-paying customers for those seats, especially when the flight is only 36 hours away. Made it seem like it was my mom’s fault for doing the upgrade even though there was no way for us to know that they have some rule about no upgrades with two seats left.

After speaking with Delta they were able to remove that fee, but I would have to book through them over the phone. Fast forward to rebooking today I checked my card and the charge did not make sense. After speaking with a rep, I was told it was because they charged a $50 service fee since they had to take over the ticket from Expedia. I was never informed of this service fee?? After being transferred and speaking with multiple reps I was able to speak to a supervisor who was very rude in behavior. She basically said she would be happy to void my ticket and I can go book through expedia with a $99 penalty charge. I told her I would be fine with the $50 fee if I was informed of it prior to paying. She said it just falls under the umbrella of general taxes, fees, and charges. She was not understanding of the situation at all and gave off the vibes that she did not care if she lost me as a customer. Now to compare: I had a ticket booked with Alaska airlines which I also needed credit but Expedia said Alaska does not offer credit. After speaking with the agent just once, she reissued me the credit in full, with no penalty charges or hidden fees. I had been in contact with Delta numerous times trying to navigate these ""Fees and charges"", in which not one told me about a $50 service fee.

"Desktop","2","review","4",,"I have been a loyal Delta customer for many years and have flown a class similar to Delta's Premium Select on their affiliated airlines including Virgin Australia and Air France. Those experiences were, for the most part, wonderful and well worth the fare difference between Comfort Plus (or its equivalent) and Premium Select (or its equivalent). 

My experience on an actual Delta flight as a Premium Select passenger between ATL and AMS was miserable. For twice the price I would have paid for Comfort Plus I got essentially THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE!!

Delta advertises that in Premium Select passengers have access to a cabin crew member dedicated exclusively to Premium Select. This is simply not true. While Premium Select passengers were served first, the same crew members were assigned to the rest of the economy classes. No dedicated crew member at all. As the flight attendant said when I asked for two cans of soda -- ""That's a good idea. I probably won't be back for quite a while.""

Delta advertises that Premium Select passengers get a ""premium travel kit."" This is simply not true. The ""travel kit"" we got even said ""Comfort Plus"" on it. It was the same one Comfort Plus received with the same eye shade, ear plugs, and really cheap toothbrushing kit. On a positive note, the noise canceling headphones and slightly larger media screens were two of the welcomed perks of Premium Select.

Delta advertises that Premium Select passengers will be served premium meals with dinnerware and cutlery similar to Delta One. This is simply not true. We received no ""menu"" as advertised. We received no ""welcoming drink"" as advertised. We were given the choice of the same food (both for dinner and breakfast) offered to the rest of the economy classes -- in plastic containers with wooden utensils. And the food was horrible -- a choice of rubber chicken with instant mashed potatoes and still half frozen cut green beans or rubber pasta for dinner and absolutely no choices for the breakfast meal. Also no snacks were served AT ALL -- not even a merger bag of pretzels. One of things I really liked about flying the Premium Select class equivalent on Virgin Australia was the help yourself snack and drink bar. Nothing fancy but if you needed a bottle of water or a bag of chips, you could serve yourself. Not so in Delta Premium Economy -- no snacks at all; no second bottle of water; nothing.

I have had better meals and a better experience in regular economy class before the pandemic -- then everyone was offered a (halfway) decent meal, a mid-flight snack (like chocolate chip cookies) and a breakfast choice that included a yogurt option instead of having an over microwaved English muffin egg and cheese sandwich basically thrown at you.

Also the seats in Premium Select are just weird. The ""foot/leg rest"" does not go up very far at all (unlike on Air France's equivalent; however, it was better than the little foot rest similar to the ones on buses I had on Virgin Atlantic). The buttons to operate the seat positions are located far down on one of the seat arms -- so far down that they are almost impossible to reach; moreover, they are all simply ""release"" buttons not button that automatically raise or lower the seat back or the foot/leg rest.

On Delta, Premium Economy isn't even a separate cabin as the equivalent class is on affiliate airlines. There is no actual partition between Premium Economy and Comfort Plus and the rear bulkhead contains a large window; no curtains; really no distinction whatsoever. Moreover, Premium Economy passages do not have access to Delta One restrooms. The flight attendants even block the passageway with carts to make sure you cannot use them. The closest restrooms are halfway back through the rest of the airplane.  Compare this with Virgin Australia where the Premium Economy class has its own dedicated restrooms as well as curtains that separate it both from first class and economy -- it is truly a separate cabin.

I will never book a Premium Select seat again on a Delta flight. Save your money. Premium Select does not offer a ""premium experience."" It is simply not worth the extra cost!!","Do NOT Pay Extra for Delta Premium Select","false","false"

Maybe Delta shouldn't book any flights until they get their act together.  This is unfair to their customers.  My neice was supposed to fly today, her flight was canceled too - she lost money on Air bnb's that won't refund her deposit, lost money on park passes.

There was no time to waste so my mother had no choice but to pay the fee and keep moving. Had we known the UM fees were $150 each way we would have paid all up front, or looked for another airlines with better policies. Finally they made it to security only to find out that the agent had put the wrong ticket in the UM's envelope and they had to go back to the ticketing counter.

I’m writing to you today cause I’m extremely disappointed and sad about the situation. My past experiences with both your companies have been positive in the last years, but with the events of the past few days I have to admit I am more than shocked with how things were handled.

After spending an entire day with you trying to book a ticket with a credit that was issued to me in the past, we were finally able to get me a ticket from Montreal to Savanna at 4:30pm Today. To confirm everything I called this morning to make sure everything was in order and since my first language is french asked to speak with a French person. A translator was a assigned to the conversation, but had to leave because no one from the customer service from delta was able to attend the conversation in 45 min…

Afterwards, I arrive 3 hours in advance to the airport to be sure not to miss my flight . I was then announced when I tried to check in that I didn’t have ticket even when I had my confirmation number and my seat on the Delta application. I then asked if I could buy a ticket or if anything could be done because the trip was really important to me as it was the MAKE A WISH trip of someone very close to me …. 

Indeed, it’s my step sisters, who I grew up with and have seen her fighting for her life time and time again during the past couple years. In fact, she is battling against dying of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Intestinal failure, Bleeding disorder excrétera. It was really important for her and me and the whole family to be on this trip… I understand you guys usually overbook flight and that it’s just business, the part however I really have difficulty getting over and that disappoints me the most is the lack of emotions, lack of ethics and lack of empathy from your team… I am not saying my situation is more important than another person on the flight, but I felt like you guys did not even want to find a solution to a problem that was initially created by you… I was willing to rebook, repay do anything to book the flight and it seems like it was impossible.

I understand that there was a baggage issue at LHR. I get that.  But to know that it’s now been 6 days and my bags have not left LHR is totally unsatisfactory!

To have items that are crucial to my work, as well as other personal items that are needed are just stuck at LHR somewhere is unsatisfactory.

In an era where customer service is more critical than ever before in maintaining customer loyalty, some large companies do it right and some companies are abject failures.
Recently, I have had the need to call on customer service from some large brands. On the plus side, Fidelity, SONOS and Citibank as example were terrific. These companies had customer service representatives that were professional, articulate, patient and totally in command of how their businesses work and how to help customers. On the other hand, DELTA AIRLINES could not even accommodate questions if one could even engage with them. Long waiting times, often hours, to reach a representative on the phone, a customer service chat line on their website that is basically worthless and cannot answer any real question other than whatever is on some section of their website. DELTA is a total disgrace in terms of ""customer service"" as the idea of service does not exist for this company. For me, who is handicapped, it is especially frustrating not being able to ask a question regarding my flight that is not covered on Delta's website.

So I was in a bit of a jam. I knew that flying economy did not give us many options as far as seating goes, but I thought I would try to ask the reps if there was anything that could be done.

Carolyn and Sean assisted me and they were both in good spirits and we had a good joking connection immediately. Carolyn was kind enough to seat me a little closer to the front and said I could board with the first group so I could avoid checking my bags. She didn’t have to care at all about my problem, but she did and I was so grateful for her kindness. 

Some time had passed and they ended up needing those seats, so I was bumped up again by the lovely Carolyn. It’s just nice that they actually cared and  went out of their way to do something for me and I was very pleasantly surprised.

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"I am still in absolute shock! My sister-in-law and I booked an urgent non-stop flight from Tampa to Seattle because being six months pregnant I kept getting horrible muscle spasms in my back and lower abdominal for a couple of days so I wanted to fly out to see my doctor in Seattle and get checked out. We payed $1,100 for two one way flights. Our flight was originally DL 459 departure at 11:40am and arrival at 2:33pm we got dropped off 2 hours before a scheduled departure like you’re supposed to. As we stood in line to check in our luggage I try to check in for our flight and I see on the delta app that the flight got cancelled. NO NOTIFICATION, NO EMAIL informing us that it got cancelled. We continue standing in line because we needed to fly out today no matter what because I was in such excruciating pain. We get to the desk and the lady (blond bob hair cut with pink glasses) was oblivious to my situation and pain. We stood waiting for some good news, at last she tells us she can’t find anything for today. My sister-in-law asked for a refund because we were not about to wait till tomorrow to fly out because the reason we got urgent tickets for today was because I need to see my doctor as soon as possible. I broke down crying right in front of all the delta workers, literally no reaction, no remorse, no help whatsoever. I stood crying while this lady started talking to some other worker, when my sister in law asked if they were trying to figure out some other alternative for us, the guy that was chatting with this lady said, “oh no, you’re done”. I sat down sobbing for 20 minutes because of the pain that I was in and the fact that I won’t be able to fly out and see my physician. Approximately 30 minutes later I receive a notification in my email that says “your flight has been cancelled but you have been rebooked to a flight that leaves at 4:20pm with an hour layover in Denver”, I got very happy because even though we originally payed for a non stop flight I just wanted to get home to Seattle. As we wait in line again for over an hour to speak to someone to make sure that this email that I got is legit and that there is room on this flight, we get called up by a delta worker (lady with really curly brunette hair wearing a gray vest). I tell her of our situation and show her the email confirmation that I got about the rescheduled flight for us and she’s like “of well you guys got your refund so you’re not on this flight, once you get your refund you’re done” and we’re like “well why did we receive this email then?” And she was like “you need to go to the person who issued you the refund”. I point to the lady that issued our refund and she was like “I issued them a refund because they asked for it” and I said “well we asked for it because you said there were no flight out of Tampa today, when in fact it looks like there is” to which I got insane attitude and rude answer from the curly haired lady saying “well you got your refund there is nothing we can do, you’re good. You can go book with other airlines”. No apologies, nothing. It looked like the delta workers were upset at us about our cancelled flight and the fact we got a refund. I have never been screwed over this bad by an airline before. I experienced such stress today that I don’t think I ever experienced which is really bad for my unborn baby and me. We received only rudeness, attitude and carelessness from the workers there. They weren’t even trying to help, they didn’t give a tiny rats ass about how this situation was not only emotionally draining on me but physically too. If I haven’t been in pains I wouldn’t strive to leave today. As my sister-in-law and I continued running through the airport with our heavy luggage trying to find any flight out of Tampa we were met with pitfalls, flights were selling out so fast that we couldn’t even book one in time.

"Desktop","5","review","0",,"My name is La Tonya  and today June 25, 2022 I was on flight DL544. While on the plane I became ill,  but tried to tough it out.  When I was leaving the plane I told the flight attendant that I wasn't feeling well.  She pulled me aside and gave me ginger ale, water and a bag in case I vomited.  As I exited the plane, she must have noticed that I didn't look well.  She was correct and I collapsed. She along with a sweet lady that was waiting to clean the plane caught me.  My friend Angela Graham told me exactly what happened. She said, the flight attendants were extremely attentive and caring. They gave me oxygen, wet towels, talked to me and made me feel safe. They immediately jumped into action and showed why they are employees of Delta. The female pilot stayed and would not leave until I was placed in a wheel chair.  The sweet lady that was waiting to clean the plane went down on the ground with me and prevented me from hurting myself.  She was squatted against the wall and my body was against her as I laid on the ground. When the flight attendant told her she could leave, 
she said ""No, I'm staying with her."" She literally stayed on the ground, holding me until I was taken away on a wheelchair. The teamwork at Delta was phenomenal.  Today, I experienced the other side of what Delta does.  Delta is a superior airline that trains the best people to take care of those in their care. This caring team that took care of me includes the female pilot, flight attendants, clean-up crew and elderly black man in the red jacket. They showed empathy and I felt it.   The paramedics and police officer
were also caring and professional. I'm feeling much better now, but I didn't want this day to end without expressing my heartfelt gratitude for Delta. May God bless each of you for what you did for me today.  I just wish there was a way that I could express my appreciation for all that was done for me. I hope this review gives the positive attention they deserve.","Delta is a superior airline","false","false"
"Desktop","3","review","0",,"Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. 

You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks.

The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket.

I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? 

It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch. But for a lot less money, $293 in my case, you can get Comfort Plus with 34 inch pitch and 17.2 inch width. 

Very disappointed with value for money, I would not waste my time paying for this seat, you may think differently of course.","Domestic first class - a waste of money IMHO","false","false"

We were given no water, no snacks, no food or hotel vouchers just told the flight had been cancelled.  I spent the worst night of my life at that airport, and I paid $1,100 for one ticket.

He was told at his gate that there weren’t any staff who could provide a wheelchair. 
  The pilot said that he would push it himself but he desperately needed a wheelchair. He was directed to where the wheelchairs were located. 
Moments later the pilot emerged from his plane with an elderly lady and his luggage. 
The elderly lady thanked him and told him,  “Go ahead. I’ll be fine. I know you got things to do.” He then leaned over and told her in hush tones, “Don’t worry. I’m going to protect you and get you to where you have to go.”

This year due to all the changes, Virgin no longer flies to US so we have to fly Delta code share and as we have a Platinum status with Virgin (while they are still in partnership) we are supposedly still entitled to facilities like the Sky lounges. With Delta we also had to fly via Sydney and that was a joke and a disaster as Sydney airport is a joke. It took us an  hour to transfer and 2.5 hours to get through security.
Premium economy this time also cost us almost $5000 - yes seats a little wider . The trip to US, we got a cloth style amenities kit just with cream, toothbrush and socks. On the way back, it was a zipped locked bag- talk about basic!! Food - going over food was ok , coming back it was appallingly poor and we had the same meal as Comfort class???

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"Delta Pet Cargo KILLED my bird.
On May 4th had a bird shipped through Delia's pet cargo service. The bird was perfe tly healthy leaving the breeder and  upon arrival I was surprised to find that the cargo pick up area had changed their normal hours and had a sign posted on the door. By the time I was supposed to pick up my bird they were closed according to their sign on the door but there was a woman that was finishing loading her vehicle at the bay door so I stopped one of the workers who was a bit rude saying ""I'm trying to leave, your bird is down at the ticket counter"" not only was it cold and raining that day but I was rather upset to find this out by chance, rather than them call me. If I had not gotten there when I did, I would have had no idea where my bird was and it likely would have sat overnight in their back room. Needless to say the cargo pickup is a separate building from the airport so I had to go down to the terminal, park, go into the ticket desk and the woman behind the counter looked so confused. 
I waited while she got whoever the guy incharge was and they found my bird in the backroom and brought her out. I signed for her and took her home. 
Once home I put her in her new cage with her food and water. She only picked at her food and I don't know that she drank anything at first. I figured it was probably from the travel and she would perk up in a day or 2. I have shipped these types of birds before and the breeder regularly ships through delta. It was not even 44 hours after picking her up from the airport that I found her DEAD in her cage. 
I was shocked and the only thing we can possibly think that may have caused this would be that she was either exposed to something in the cargo area or backroom as birds lungs are extremely sensitive, or she was left in a cold area for too long and got pneumonia. My other bird which is the same breed, that was in his own cage about 3 feet away from hers is perfectly healthy and has had no issues and I have another of the same breed I'm my office, also no issues. So at some point during the time Delta had the bird something happened. And Delta REFUSES to take responsibility  for the death of this animal. They say because the bird didn't die in their possession that it isn't their problem. 
I'm sorry, but that is not the right answer. Not only was the bird expensive but proper protocol was NOT followed and if there was ""temporary"" hours they should not have allowed the booking or they should have called me to atleast notify me. Customer service is saying those ""temporary"" hours were only for that day. But, that sign says ""Effective January 24th, we will be open Monday - Friday 4am - 4pm closed Saturday and Sunday until further notice due to short staffing. We apologize for any inconvenience."" 
So apparently being short staffed gives them the excuse to not follow proper protocol and put animals health at risk and cause the death of people's pets and then they won't do anything about it. I even went up there today just to be sure and took a picture of the sign STILL on their door.
This is unacceptable. I paid $800 for a very hard to find breed of bird and then $200 for Delta to kill it and then not do anything about the situation except say that it's not their fault? 
And above all else, my 5 year old daughter was so excited about our new bird and is still devastated.

The Delta Airline agent that checked us in saw our vaccination cards and our Negative PCR tests that was valid for 24 hours before departure, but she forced us to get another test at the Airport. We paid $1000.00 and 1hour of stress and unreasonable delay at the Airport. Two other family friends that were being checked with the agent next to us had the same Negative PCR test and Vaccine information and I heard that the agent told them, either Vaccine or Negative PCR is needed to board the plane and they got boarded with no problem. I learned that every agent interprets the guidelines according to what they understand and there is no defined process.
I pointed that to our agent, and she rudely denied it and shouted at me, “You’re wasting your time, and if I was you, I’ll go downstair and take the test immediately”
I’m very much OK with enforcing the rules and regulations from FDA and Delta but not all gate agents are on the same page, and this create bias among passengers. When we got back to the line with the new Negative PCR test results, we went to a different line and another agent.
She checked us in with no problem and gave us our luggage tickets, but she couldn’t print our boarding passes. After several tries, she said “Air France did not issue the tickets from their end, and she has to fix it with them”.

Three days before our flight home from Orlando back to New York, my boyfriend and I go on to seat selection on the Delta website and not a single seat is available so we figured seats weren't available for selection yet, only to later find out that Delta already assigned us a ""Seats Assigned at Gate"" ticket. 

We get to the gate and go up to the desk and the workers tell us that we need to wait until everyone gets on the plane in order for them to assign us a seat since they stupidly overbooked the plane already and were more worried about trying to get people off of the plane to take a later flight for a $900 voucher and weren't even boarding people on the plane in time. People were obviously angry and they even called a police officer to the gate knowing people would potentially be aggressive over their bs. 

We then see everyone get on the plane and we walk up to the desk again and they were incredibly rude telling us to keep waiting. They then call my boyfriend's name and give him a seat assignment ticket and he says well my girlfriend is here too and I want to get on with her since they told us we'd be seated together and they made him just get in the line without me. He walks up to the ticket scanner woman and he said I want to get on with my girlfriend and she goes ""Well why isn't she here? Is she in the bathroom?"" So he tells her I'm standing literally in front of the desk since the people at the desk told me to wait and then she rudely shouts to me well get over here then. 

I walk over and my carry on is a roller bag so she instantly starts tagging it to check it in and I was like no I want to bring it on and she's like it's not going to fit and I'm like um yes it is... I was literally on a flight a few days ago with it in the overhead bin. She then lies and just says oh well there's no room left and to take anything I need or breakable out which was the entire bag since it was filled with breakable souvenirs. I was like well I'm going to risk it then and bring it on since I know you have room and she angrily was like you have more than 2 bags on you anyways which isn't allowed by law on flights when her idiot self told me to take things out of my bag for the plane. I was so angry that I ripped the tag off of my bag in her face and threw it and got on the plane with it just to put it in the overhead bin anyways since there was space. 

Recommendations for passengers: If Delta tags your carry-on, just rip it off and get on the plane with it anyways since they are lying about how much space is left or do yourself a favor and pick another airline since they don't know how to treat passengers like humans.

The seats are cramped and uncomfortable.  Amenities are nonexistent.  No entertainment provided unless one had already downloaded the Westjet app, which we didn’t know about.  In flight internet was not working.  Four hours plus on the first leg to Toronto was pure torture, and suffering from the Canadian government’s mask superstition, one was constantly nagged about a mask.

Of course Delta and Westjet don’t exchange adequate passenger information to provide a seamless experience.  Westjet initially received ticketing, passport, vaccination and Covid test information.  Delta of course asked for all the same information  again in Tornado, and inflicted another CDC form that was an attestation of vaccine.  That information was already in their database, but it was nice to have another delay to fill out a form.  We were blamed for the form at the gate trick because we hadn’t stopped at the Delta desk.  Stopping at their partner’s where we checked our bags all the way through, because they didn’t hand out or collect that form.

Our final intermediate stop was LaGuardia, which is a disgusting mess.  On concourse D there is virtually no seating for the dozen or so gates the are downstairs and fenced in with plywood barriers.  People are herded and treated like cattle.  

Of course the toilet clogged in our plane and we were sent back to the corral, where the only seating that had magically appeared was in a far corner out of range of the gate announcements.  After complaining they included our area in the public address radius.

We are now forecast to leave in another hour, and they will seal off the forward head.  Why that tales an hour is anyone’s guess.

Unfortunately Delta is probably still a better carrier than United, which is damning them with faint praise.  Their customer service officially sucks.  The herding on concourse D is inexcusable and expresses complete contempt for the customer.

(actually for 196 and 197 both directions from SEA-INC),  No dedicated lavatories for Premium Select, which would be OK, wi there were enough lavatories.  You have to walk back quite a ways before you can get to one.  Not enough waiting space for lavatories - DO NOT FLY DELTA's 330-NEOs if think access to lavatories should be convenient.
Food awful for both dinner and breakfast.
330-Neo was fairly new, so inoperable remote is extremely inconvenient - at least the touch screen worked, but updates slow and movies halted making viewing unpleasant.
Seats were set 2-3-2 so better than the 2-4-2 in the back, and OK for sitting but the recline was inadequate for sleeping, so get a window seat if available, so you an lean on the wall, or splurge for Business (except probably double to three times the price).  A window seat in regular economy would be better than non-window in premium for sleeping.

"Desktop","3","review","1",,"Hello. I don’t usually write reviews, but every where we went in Seattle, they seemed to want a review on trip advisor so I thought why not write one about our experience flying with Delta. First off, our flight times going to Seattle and flying back kept changing, which is fine if you have a flexible schedule. We were only in Seattle for a few days so we wanted to make the most of it, but we had to leave so early going there and back that we essentially lost the first and last day in Seattle. Second, we paid extra to choose our seats, but because they switched our flights the seats were changed as well. The long flight coming home, my aunt and I had to sit a row apart from each other. When we asked to have the seats changed back, the guy at the airport told us “that’s what you get for booking so far in advanced!” Great customer service 👍 He also proceeded to tell us that the reason they made her switch seats was because they put “couples” together in the seats. Well, that’s nice but we were together so not sure why we pay extra to pick our seats for Delta to move us apart so “couples” can sit together. For all Delta knows, we could have been a couple!!","Bad customer service","false","false"
"Desktop","1","review","1",,"For those thinking of booking with Delta, just don’t. I wish I could give them zero stars that‘s how terrible their customer service is.

They couldn’t find our reservation today (after spending 2+ hours back in Feb trying to get it scheduled), so we had to spend our entire afternoon rectifying THEIR mistake, just to be spoken down to and receive absolutely no compensation for all of the trouble.

Apparently they find it okay to just remove paying customers’ confirmations randomly and are convinced we should be okay with wasting our days trying to resolve it.

Now I’m worried that they still won’t be able to locate our reservation when checking in for the flight... I truly hope we never have to result in flying with them again. I’d rather give my business to literally any other airline.

I’m attaching a very small part of the chat conversation for everyone’s record. As someone who has been in customer service for years, I’m just baffled that they are a leading company within the industry with such awful customer service skills.

"Desktop","2","review","2",,"So I flew first class with Delta from Panama to NYC in early May 2022, and I am still cringing at my experience.

The gaps in the arm rest and the area where the folding table is located are dirty and in major need of vacuuming and cleaning. The seatback monitors are outdated. I couldn't even see the TV characters on the screen. They're washed out, colorless, and blurry. The in-flight entertainment was oddly limited on this flight (it's weird because I took a flight with Delta before with a wider selection of movies). Mind you ... this is first class.

The legroom just isn't enough. If this is the largest legroom I can get on a flight, I'd hate to see what economy looks like.

The only reason I didn't give Delta Airlines one star is because the staff was amazing and attentive. And also, surprisingly, the food was actually VERY good! I had lots of tea, lots of snacks, and some red wine, too. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Delta Airlines first class. Unfortunately, you can't use their first class lounge when purchasing this ticket. You have to subscribe to their Skyclub membership credit card thing first. Honestly, it's just not worth it.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"TLDR: the context of this review is that you're paying first class money which is more like economy with a better meal, if any. You could easily pick up better food in the airport post security and eat better for cheaper.

Sky priority: we were directed to check in normally. Not sure what we were paying for, but the employees stated our flight wasn't serviced... 

First class: they 'ran out' of the meal advertised that my fiancee could eat... Not sure what we were paying for... The seats are right next to where they prep the food , so lots of banging... If you sit on 1a or 1b at night you'll get blasted with light from their kitchen... If you are not sitting in 1abc or d, if the person in front of you reclines fully, you won't be able to have a 12 inch laptop out without it being on top of you . Not sure what we were paying for... Also, if fully reclined, good luck getting out. My petite fiancee could barely squeeze out... Imagine paying first class and having to ask or be asked to put your seat up from the people behind/Infront of you.

Boarding first class: imagine being called up after hours of delay, with a wedding dress, and then told to sit back down for 20 minutes...  But losing your airport seats that were also holding your wedding dress... And then stepping away to the adjacent bathroom for a men's Pee break... Only to come back to everyone loading out of order. They claimed they recalled first class but when boarding it was obvious... Not sure what we were paying for ...

Our flight: 10+ delays. I say + because we were actually notified of every delay, and the majority of delays we were made aware of was after the app was updated. We had I think 4 gate changes ... Imagine lugging around a wedding dress , not being told of gate changes until after others, and then not having the ability to sit or set down the dress... When we finally got on the plane, it was easily 85F. Everyone was sweating like crazy.... It was like that for at least thirty minutes because, surprise, another delay without communication... Just sitting in the plane for an hour... Finally, when taking off and finally in the air, elongated and repeated messages about the delay, thanks for flying, etc ... So in flight entertainment was useless for about 30-40 minutes because you got constant interrupting every 5 minutes... not sure what we were paying for. Landing was fine. Dca take off was a little wonky. Seats are meh

Wifi: just fyi, the way delta advertises their wifi implies it is free at a glance. It costs money, but I knew that. I didn't use it because imo it is a waste

When trying to book with the online agent, they quoted me a price three times that of my original booking price (before the site crashed). In addition, I was disconnected from the online agent before finalizing my flight. My last resort was to call the Delta help number, as the last time I called for my previous booking (several months ago), I was on hold for four hours. Anyhow, I waiting a little over an hour this time to be connected to an agent who was courteous but unable to assist in retrieving my original booking information and price.

Go check the CNBC article named 'This is the worst airline in the U.S., according to a new ranking — and it’s not Spirit or Frontier' published in Feb 2022. 

First my flight time was delayed for an hour before boarding. After boarding the flight, they had to trouble shoot an issue. I stayed inside the plane for more than 2 hours during the troubleshooting. When they couldn't figure out the issue we had to get off the plane because of protocol issue. I waited another 90 mins at the gate while they scrambled to find a replacement plane. Eventually they found one and by the time I got to ATL it was 1:30am ET when it was supposed to be 7:30pm ET. I ended up getting COVID from the trip and I suspect me staying inside the plane and airport for the extended amount of time might have something to do with it. 

Unfortunately that was not the worst part of the experience. What's worse was when I tried to make a complain through their website. I called the Customer Service line and the wait time was 2+ hours. When I tried using the chat room I spent 40 mins with an agent only to tell me in the end I had to call the Customer Service line because they couldn't help me.

Flying back was the issue. My flight was scheduled for 2:25pm i arrived at the airport in a hurry at around 12:15 because i was not able to check in online. Once I got to PTY airport, as soon as i stepped in the airport they treated me terrible. I wish i could remember the delta employees name at the airport but whoever it was does not need a profession at Delta because if i am not mistaken ""Delta is the superior airline in terms of customer service, free flight changes, and overall experience"". I have been flying with Delta for over 15 years through my father Carlos Ramos account along with making my own in 2021 and that was maybe my worst decision because i never want to fly delta again. Superior airline in terms of customer service is not true, nor is free flight changes or experience. After being on hold for 4+ hours for 3 days straight i have yet to have been accommodated in any way. I have been given $171 in flight credit which doesn't make me feel like a valued customer at all, indeed it makes me feel like I'm being thrown back the money i paid and told my feelings don't matter. 2 Days ago, i spoke with an amazing women Ms. Sangria, i must say, she is the definition of customer service and somebody you need on your time. I've been in tears for days about the way i was treated. Ms. Sangria instantly put a smile on my face as she gave so much sympathy and apology for the mistreatment i was given. As opposed to Ms Joanne Patricia who is apparently a supervisor and has been in the customer service industry for 22 years. Whoever Ms. Sangria is, she needs a raise!!!! Although we were disconnected mid call, i felt like she genuinely cared about my concerns, and she is the only reason i would ever take another delta flight. I was on hold for 5 hours today eventually called back by cell from Ms. Joanne after putting in a complaint on Delta.com and she constantly cut me off and disregarding my feelings and concerns. As a supervisor i am disgusted. She literally told me ""I see your concern and i read that you are a valued loyal customer but i just wanted to let you know you've only been a SkyMiles member since 2021"" that is disgusting. I have been flying delta for over a decade and i have had many different SkyMiles accounts and this is just rude and not how you treat people. Claiming to have been in customer service for 22 years i would've at least gotten an apology. I asked her if there was any way that i can be transferred to Ms. Sangria and she replied "" well i don't know which one there's 4"" like i am in complete shock between this ""superior"" airline and Ms. Joanne Patricia's horrendous customer service along with the workers in PTY airport she belongs as the supervisor over there. I had to literally miss my flight even though i was ready to check in at 12:15 instead the workers in PTY airport were doing everything in their power to not get me on my flight. I had to purchase an extra night at the hotel along with another flight this time thankfully through American airline which took me 20 minutes at most to get my boarding pass, check my bag in, and get to my gate. Yet Delta has still not been accommodated me at all. This is crazy. When speaking with Ms Sangria, she said she would give me an additional 200$ in credit along with my flight credit which was 171$ and when speaking to Ms Joanne she was insisting that she would not approve that because she is the supervisor and doesn't know what to tell me.

After saying this they then proceeded to tell me I cannot board my flight, and could not give me a legitimate reason as to why. The exact words I was told was “oh well you should've got here earlier. She told me she could book me a new flight for the next day and said the price would be $400 when online the same exact flight was $144.

"Desktop","1","review","4",,"I took a flight from Houston to  ATL on Delta this month. I checked one suitcase, and the Delta Ticket Agent at the Delta Counter told me that I would need to check my duffle bag also. I told him that it could fit in the overhead compartment. He said that he was sorry, but the duffel bag would need to be checked. I had to pay $70.00 for two checked bags. When I boarded the plane, I placed my carry on in the overhead bin. I looked at the overhead bin and realized that my duffle bag could have easily fitted in the overhead bin. I am referencing the same duffle bag that the Delta Ticket Agent told me that I would have to check.
I was disappointed, but the situation regarding my checking baggage gets worse.

After the plane lands in Atlanta, I exit the plane and head to baggage claim. Upon arriving at the luggage carousel that corresponds to my flight, I check the luggage tags and grab my two checked bags from the carousel. While I am still in baggage claim, I open my two bags to ensure all my items are in the bag.  As I checked my bags, I discovered that 2 brand new shirts  were missing that I had packed in the duffle bag that the Delta Ticket Agent told me that I had to check. I was in shock. I concluded that these two shirts were taken out of my duffle bag sometime between after the ticket agent in Houston placed the luggage tags on my checked bags and sent them down the conveyor belt and before my checked bags were placed on the conveyor belt for the luggage carousel in Atlanta.

Upon discovering that 2 new shirts were removed from my checked bags, I inquired with personnel in baggage claim where to file a claim regarding checked bags. I went to the appropriate line and waited patiently to speak with a Delta Representative. When it was my turn to see the Delta Baggage Representative, I explained to her why I wanted to file a claim regarding my baggage. The rep informed me that they to not take claim information at the Delta Baggage Counter. The rep handed me a piece of paper with a 1-800#  on it to contact Delta Airlines regarding my baggage issue. The rep at the baggage counter stated that the phone lines for the 1-800# that she gave me were answered 24 hours per day and 7 days a week.  Why does Delta have persons working a desk who can not file a baggage claim for you? In my opinion, that is a misallocation of human capital resources. 

I called that same 1-800# that the baggage rep gave me two times on the day this happened. The first time that I called, the automated system informed me that my wait time to speak to a representative was 7 hours and 31 minutes. The second phone call resulted in the automated system telling me that my wait time would be 6 hours and 45 minutes.

This is the first time that items have been stolen out of my checked luggage when flying from one point to another on any airline.

The pilots and the flight attendants provided excellent customer service on the flight to Atlanta. They had options for snacks and beverages. I give the flight crew 5 stars.

We had a poor experience flying Delta out of Tel Aviv.  We were told to get to the airport 4 hours before our flight.  But, they didn't really give us any further instructions.  We wasted time, not realizing we had to go through security before checking in our bags.  Counter did open 4 hours before our flight.   

But, there's not any great reason to get to the airport that early.  The lounge access provided to the Dan lounge was a poor experience.  Hot soup and cold salads.  We both had digestive issues afterwards.  I was advised at boarding that my tray table was not working and they couldn't repair it.  

Upon boarding my wife's seatbelt wasn't working and they had to bring on someone to fix it.  Not feeling great about the aircraft maintainance.  

The attitude of the flight crew was cold.  No warmth or enthusiasm.  It didn't feel like a first or business class experience.  The food was economy level at best.  Snacks were put our in the crew service area but they never told us about them or brought them through the cabin.  The good news was the flight took off on time and actually arrived at JFK early.  However, our priority checked bags didn't seem to have any priority in getting to baggage claim.

The lie flat seat experience left something to be desired.  Not very comfortable.  No duvet provided, just an oversized blanket that you could put partly under and partly over.  Banged my knees repeatedly on the sides of the cabin when rolling over.  For tall skinny travelers this seat could work.  I've never seen a footwell that deep.  

Having a closed door was a minor convenience.  I was able to change into sleep clothes discreetly at my seat rather than in the bathroom which was much better.  They provded an amenity kit with socks, slippers but no pajamas.

The flight from JFK to LAX was like night and day.  The Delta lounge at JFK proved to be excellent.  Great selection of HOT foods for breakfast at a buffet and good coffee.

Another passenger had a problem with their arm rest.  It kept collapsing.  Again a questionable maintainance program.

The flight crew on the LAX flight was outstanding.  Warm, friendly, attentive.  The food served was excellent.  Not just OK, but excellent stuffed french toast.  The cabin crew continually made passes through the cabin to see if anyone needed anything.  More so that I ever recall seeing. One of the crew proactively asked if they could hang up my jacket and returned it to me without me asking.  On all the flights we took on this trip no one else did that.

On both flights we were disappointed by the lack of new movies to watch.  Couldn't find anything good that we hadn't already seen.  Ended up rewatching a couple of classics, but it's not the same.

The pilots have to wear certain clothing to distinguish themselves. The flight attendant have mandates. The customers have mandates, IE masks. Yes, you DO mandate what is worn for peoples heath and safety. This applies to mental health as well. Anxiety is real and  the Spiderman costume concerned your flight attendant enough for her to phone in about it, but alas, she was given NO authority to remove this customer. Drunk and unruly, you get on a ""no fly list"" But causing ""frightfullness"" , "" anxiety"" and fear of terror on a flight in a concealed costume...is just fine by Delta.
To not be concerned for the passengers in your policy of ""not restricting what people wear"" is a horrible policy. Can I get on the plane in a thong underwear and bra and a gas mask. I  doubt it, but maybe I'll try it out. Spiderman could have very been a concealed terrorist and no one would have been able to identify him. You still think you have a good policy there??","Frightened  by person fully disguised in spiderman costume","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"Back on January 24th, my husband and I booked our flights to San Francisco and back via Delta. We decided to splurge and purchase first class tickets for the comfort, and partially because we did not want to have seat issues flying main cabin as we have had in the past. Two days before we returned to Richmond, I received an email stating that first class was overbooked and I was being downgraded. This was not acceptable, since we were the first ones to book our seats on the flight in January. The email said I was receiving a $200 “goodwill” credit, which was nonsense considering it was just the difference in ticket cost. 

I immediately went online and messaged Delta via text. I was able to get in touch with Arriane the day before the flight. I basically stated this was unacceptable and the person that booked my seat last should be the one to have been moved back, especially since he was a single traveler and I was with my husband. She told me there was nothing she could do because the “system was not letting her change it.” I asked to be placed on the upgrade list at the top of the line since this was not acceptable. She told me she would place me on the list with a note telling them I was originally first class and should be considered first in line.

The following day when we landed at Atlanta, I went to our gate and inquired again about being moved back and getting my seat back. The woman at the gate was less than helpful, telling me (and others) that she was not taking flight questions until 15 minutes before boarding began. She told me to walk halfway down the terminal to the Delta counter across from gate B19 to ask about it. So I did.

I talked to a woman whose name I did not get at the far end of the counter and told her what was going on. She first informed me that Arriane lied to me via text and that I was not anywhere on the upgrade list. She also told me that there were several people already on it, so she wouldn’t place me on it because it was pointless. She then informed me that the reason I was bumped is because the place for the flight was swapped out and we were taking a smaller one back to Richmond that had fewer first class seats. I left even more frustrated and angry at the situation, however if this was true, I 'could' see the reasoning for it. 

When I finally boarded, I found out that she also lied to me, and there was someone else in my seat, 2C, while my husband watched as my face turned red. Apparently, Delta employees are told to lie to their customers to avoid confrontation, because all three that I had to deal with were useless. 

We usually travel main cabin, but I avoided it on this trip so I wouldn’t have seat issues, yet there I was separated from my husband because Delta always seems to find a way to screw something up.  I was kicked out of the seat we booked first and 3 months prior to someone who booked last minute - why wasn’t he reassigned!?

Second, the $200 “goodwill” credit was a complete waste considering it was just a difference of ticket cost. I lost my seat, was furious the last 2 days of our vacation, and Delta employees lied to me every step of the way. If this is how Delta works, I may need to find a new airline.

Finally, it was interesting to also hear how Delta overbooked all of the flights we were on in SFO and ATL. In SFO, they were offering $1,000 in cash for main cabin volunteers to take a later flight that day. In ATL, $600 for the same - and people took it. It was free money, and they still got their flight and seat. After all I went though, I saw no compensation for the lies and aggravation. The last horrible experience I went through with Delta was met with “I’m sorry, here’s 10,000 Skymiles.” I would expect something more for all of the BS. There needs to just be a law already banning overbooking. They make record profits every year, they can deal with an empty seat or two.","Overbookings and Lies","false","false"

At LA, there was no waiting about at the baggage carouse wondering if my stuff was going to appear - my name was called and the Delta ground staff explained that my bags were still in Amsterdam, would be brought over the following day, and to contact the ground staff at my final destination, Albuquerque.

At Albuquerque, I went to the Delta desk and gave my name, and the desk clerk said ‘ah yes! They told me you’d be coming in’

I gave my accommodation address and sure enough, my luggage was delivered as promised the following day.

Delta has the best free entertainment options, even when I used to fly economy class. So you can pass the time good because their screens are a good size and they have a ton of programming to choose from.

Should out to James who was our FA on both flights, oddly enough. Good service. For the domestic flights under 3 hours though Delta needs to offer better food to their first class fliers. We had some sort of ""bakery box"" as they call it which was awful, dry packaged granola, not even low calorie stuff haha. If I'm going to slam the calories it should at least taste good. Second flight was even less they gave us a bag of chips or something. So I know certain airlines have time limits they need to reach in order to serve actual food, but bring it up on the snacks. That was my only complaint.

Also make the lounges more available for first class fliers who don't want to be in your status club but will just pay the fares and go about their business. Or advertise it better they can purchase a one time use pass or something.

We landed in Atlanta at the scheduled time and boarded the connecting flight to Savanah. 
The interior of the aircraft was sweltering, and no one thought to start the AC until complaints started. We waited at least 75 minutes because there were no pilots available. By the time the flight crew arrived the weather was worsening and they said they were about to ""time out"".
We taxied out and then turned around because the pilot said they had timed out. This turning around maneuver seemed  dangerous and then there was no gate available for an additional 25 minutes
At the gate there was complete confusion. A Delta representative said for everyone to hold tight and not leave because most likely they would call in a flight crew and we would reboard the plane and be on our way.
We all  received multiple text and email updates to new departure times, 
12:30, 1:50, 2:30 until we finally received a text and email around 3:30 a.m. that the flight was cancelled. 
A group of us were going to hire ground transportation but we were told we could not get our luggage ( it was basically held hostage )until 7 a.m. the next morning, and that it would not go to Savanah unless we booked another flight. 
At 6 a.m. I went to a hotel completely exhausted. 
Delta was not able to book me a new flight until 11:10 p.m. on the 7th. ( 26 hours later ! )
This was not weather related but rather a scheduling problem. The weather was no issue when we landed or when we were scheduled to depart.
No Delta employees ever returned to the gate to explain anything.  We were completely lied to about most everything.

Our flight back from Orlando, FL to Seattle, WA, DL1118 was delayed at MCO for apprx. 2 hrs due to weather conditions. We were told that our next flight to Portland, OR, DL2977, was held to catch 25 connecting passangers (which it was easy to wait for an extra half an hour and board on a small plane, inho). However, it departed right after we landed. The customer service representative was able to switch our tickets to the next flight, which is at 7:35 am. This delay was not our fault, but we were not provided with any accommodations for the night. We went and bought late dinner and now we are spending the night laying down on the floor and sitting in hard plastic chairs - adults and kids. I was told that Delta is #1 customer satisfaction company. However, this negligence of the essential customers' needs from Delta tells the true story.
With this simple careless attitude the other good customer service that we received from other representatives of your company was nullified. I've been told that Delta does not provide any hotel or a room or any food in these cases. It makes me feel that we are a different type of customers- not the first class, not privileged, and that's why we can be ignored. 
I'm giving 3 stars for great pilots job, which itself is worthy of 10 stars.

I went to back to the airport and checked with lost and found etc but it had not been turned in. Thankfully a flight attendant called me and told me she found my wallet on the plane but she was now in Detroit with it . She was trying to figure out a way to get it on a returnLing flight to Charlotte that day, with another flight attendant or she was going to bring it herself in two days on a returning flight. it seemed it would all work out and then the Gate manager got involved and confiscated it from the flight attendant. The gate manager promised the flight attendant  that they would call me ASAP but no one called. (Still no call three days later(.
I called the Detroit Delta Lost and Found, the next morning, and spoke to an agent and explained that the wallet was located and positively handed off to the  Manager  of all the Delta gates at A27 on March 27th. The gate manager is aware of who I am and my wallet….
The woman on the phone said to me that they had not retrieved any of the found items from the gates and it wasn’t really a priority!!! I exclaimed that I was stranded in Charlotte until I could get my wallet back. I begged her to take my phone number and She rudely told me to fill out an online report. That was it! I did as she asked and waited all day. Nothing. It’s now  three days later and I am still waiting.
I had to cancel my flight. I’m missing work and I have no money or ID. I can’t believe how unhelpful Delta has been. I will never fly again with this airline.

I should mention that the first blow was that on my 5 and 1/2 hour , red eye flight from SFO to Atlanta  we were not offered anything to drink. Not even water. when I asked the flight attendant , he was very rude and returned with a half full plastic cup of water. I was extremely dehydrated the entire flight.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"Our flight departed at 5:39am, so we showed up 2 hours prior to departure. Their ticket desk wasn't open, so we were stuck in the lobby with dozens of other passengers for over an hour. This caused a massive crowd and lots of confusion going thru airport security.

As if that wasn't bad enough, for whatever reason... despite my husband and I being ticketed on the same confirmation, we weren't assigned seats next to each other. When he made the reservations, he made sure to request a window seat for me... but somehow Delta assigned us to middle seats on the opposite side of the aisle. He spent OVER 2 HOURS on hold on Saturday trying to get our seats reassigned so we would be next to each other, only for the customer service agent to tell him that we would need to speak to the agent at the desk to get reassigned. My husband tried to ask, but couldn't even finish asking his question because the agent cut him off and rudely announced over the intercom that there would be no seat reassignments.

He asked the flight crew as we boarded, only to be met with blank stares and headshakes. They were unwilling to move other passengers to keep us together. We were now at the mercy of our fellow passengers… none of which were willing to switch seats to keep us together.

I’m sure you’re wondering why this is important… I’ve flown frequently, and have noticed that sitting in the middle causes me to have anxiety, motion sickness, and feelings of claustrophobia. And this was all exaggerated by having to wear a mask for a prolonged period of time. My only chance for comfort on this flight, was having my husband by my side, and being switched to a window or aisle seat.

I almost immediately had the worst panic attack of my life. Full out crying and shaking. Their flight crew walked up and down the aisles past me, not caring that they played a part in my suffering by not moving other passengers to keep me with my husband. And my husband was unable to comfort me, being stuck across the aisle and between two strangers, so this flight was rough on him too. Finally, when one of the flight attendants did ask me what was wrong (while pushing the drink cart up the aisle) I told him, thru my tears, that I needed my husband. He asked me where my husband was, and I told him, but he did nothing to correct my situation.

My panic attack lasted the duration of the flight. And I’m talking full out crying, sobbing, shaking. I choked down my own vomit several times because there was no barf bag in the seat back, and the very large lady beside me wouldn’t let me out of my seat because it “was too hard” for her to get up. But she had no problem shoving in to me to turn on and off the overhead light repeatedly and crank up the air conditioning vent causing me to shiver uncontrollably… as if shaking from a panic attack wasn’t enough.  

I couldn’t get off the plane fast enough. I was so shaken that I didn’t want to get on our connecting flight. I was so traumatized by this flight that we actually debated about finding a way to cancel the connecting flight and rent a car to drive from Detroit to Pittsburgh.

All in all, Their team had several opportunities to correct the situation and dropped the ball repeatedly. Completely disappointed. I’ve always had a high opinion of Delta until now. I’ll probably never fly Delta again, based solely on this experience.","Worst Flight EVER - Customer Service is Non-Existent","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I Have had the worst experience with Delta compared to any other airline I have traveled with. I arrived to the airport 3 hours before my flight around 3 pm on March 17 to my flight from Orlando to New York With my elderly mother who was also traveling with me. The flight kept getting delayed till 12:25 am because they weee missing a pilot. I have never heard of that before that an airline was missing a pilot for his scheduled flight. Around 12:25 am when all the passengers are boarded, they tell everybody to leave the airplane because the flight has been canceled. I had reserved the flight for specifically that day because I had work next morning. I work as Nurse and have never missed the day of work because I know important it is to be there for my patients and am always committed to their safety. I for the first time in my career had to call out for work the next morning because the “pilot” was not there and then the flight was cancelled, at absolutely no fault if my own. Not only did I miss out on a pay day that was very important, It also tainted my reputation as a competent nurse. Regardless, I was still patient, after waiting in line for more than 2 hrs I finally was able to speak to a flight representative and they have my mother and I a flight the next day at 2:59 pm, which meant we would have to weight more than 14 hours for the next flight. As I asked about accommodations for overnight, I was told by the representative “we dont do that, you have to book hotels on your own”. I have never heard that from a flight representative, I have had flight delays before but accommodations were ready for all passengers to not make the experience any more difficult. Not having any choice, we were forced to sleep in the airport without any blankets or pillow or food vouchers. All food expenses were paid out of my pocket. I was just eager to go home and was in no mood to talk to people that were not able to do their jobs properly. As the time for the next flight came nearer, the flight was again delayed and eventually canceled after taking the passengers into the plane and then again kicking us out. We were told no more flights were available for the rest of the day to NY and next flight was for the day after. I have had enough of this incompetence and needed to get my mother home as her medications were at house and could not stay to view this circus any longer. Without any choice left, I booked a flight to Washington DC for my mother and I on Southwest Airlines  and then from DC to NYC by bus. We were extremely tired, frustrated, and absolutely disappointed in the staff working for delta and the company itself because they clearly do not care about their customers for the experience I have had. Not to mention my 2.5 hr flight turned into 36 hours of charades.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I am very unhappy. My plane was set to leave at 7:20PM then only 5 hours prior to the flight the plane was delayed and moved to 10:10PM and then they changed it to 8:40PM takeoff and then after boarding 30 minutes later then the boarding time of 8:05PM we are sitting on the plane for over two and a half hours long on the runway. They say we’re about to take off and then we are just waiting around for two hours on the plane completely claustrophobic super not COVID friendly whatsoever and all they tell us is that they have to wait to switch directions. After they said they were able to get an alternative route they say the plane doesn’t have enough fuel to do the alternative route and say we have to go back to the gate. Then we are told that the plane isn’t aloud to take off and that we are “fortunate” to have a gate to come back to because some planes have to just sit and wait on the runway when their is no available gates. My question is, if you originally had the flight at 7:20 departure and then delayed it to 10:10 WHY would you then undelay it and then only move it to 8:40??? Because we’ve been on the plane for more then the second delay time of 10:10. I am extremely disappointed. This was my first experience on delta airlines and this will be my last!!! I have flown on 100+ legs, over 10 different countries and I have never experienced an issue like this before. At least on my other airplane experience they kept us INFORMED. Delta is not transparent and clearly is aware of the situation so why move the delay down just to have everyone sit on the plane for 4 hours past the original departure time? This is the time that I should be arriving at my destination. And the only thing they tell us is “sorry” and then offer our head phones to people and say “these are normally $2 but we’re giving them away because of the delay” TWO DOLLAR HEADPHONES treating it like they are doing us a huge favor… they should at the very least gave us food… I am blown away and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the company. Then they kick everyone off the plane after sitting in it for hours and tell us the staff needs to go home because they’ve been overworked and can’t go over there hours and that we need to just wait to see what will happen and when they will get new staff and they kept reiterating that the flight was not going to be cancelled only delayed, and then BOOM After waiting from 5:45pm to 12:45am (SEVEN HOURS) I find out that are 1:42AM (delayed 5 times) is now CANCELLED. They told me the next flight at 6am is fully booked and then next flight will arrive around at 6pm on Friday. I am missing an entire day in my destination zone and my original flight I had picked specifically based off the time to make sure I would not be missing any work and now I am missing an entire day worth of work and who’s going to reimburse me for that? And also let my job know? I think after waiting 7 hours for a flight where the staff decided to disappear and sitting inside an airport breathing in the air of other people who could potentially have COVID during this pandemic. Completely unacceptable whatsoever. Delta can state that the plane was cancelled due to weather but I don’t agree with that, they are using that as an excuse so that they are no liable for my flight and all the people who had to sit around for 7 hours waiting with full hope for a flight that got cancelled when the crew left. I deserve to be compensated and if Delta is too cheap to even do that then I would like to get a refund because the airline does not deserve my company or business if they can’t care for their consumers and even take the time of day to let them know what’s going on.

Now they are horrible. We booked our flight 2 months in advance.. consisting of 3 connecting flights. The day of our flight, we printed boarding passes, cleared TSA, and got to gate at 530 AM.. for 6AM flight .. no one there, no plane, no agent. Flight cancelled.  No text, or email. NO NOTIFICATIONS FLIGHT CANCELLED!

Delta agent couldn’t rebook us because her “computer was so slow” it wouldn’t let her change our flights. ?? She recommended that we call customer service..it had a 4 HOUR call back time. 
The delta agent was ridiculously undertrained and couldn’t navigate the scheduling software. 

Trying to rebook to a new flight online was a waste of time as as the app wouldn’t let us change our tickets without DOWN GRADING our seats .

So now waiting for our 4 HOUR call back.

It took us about 20 minutes to fill out the form for all passengers and when we returned to the desk to finish check in..  they had given our four first class tickets away to somebody on standby.  30 minutes before our flight!!!  What??  They knew we were there!  We had already talked to them!!  There way to resolve it?  Fly ti Santiago and drive four hours to punta Cana or split up our family and two go to Boston and the other two go to Atlanta and hope to get a flight by way of standby:  not happening.  So we all flew to Atlanta.  When we got there they gate attendant laughed at us.  Said there was NO way were were getting on the plane as it was already overbooked!  What a joke.  So we had to catch a flight late the next day.  Missed out on 2 days of our vacation.  Money gone.  Memories gone.  They didn’t care.  THEN, on our way back..  we flew in to JFK airport.  Had two hours to make our connecting flight to Indy.  Plenty of time we thought..  since delta booked the flights.  Nope.  Had to get thru customs, find our checked bag (they told us carousel 2 only to come on the intercom 20 minutes later and say oops..  carousel 4 actually), then go thru security again!  We even did the clear check to speed up the process.  My husband took off running to get to gate B 47.  I ran behind carrying a toddler and running with my 12 year old and pulling our luggage.  We ran the length of 47 gates!!!  That’s a long way to run!!  He made it there first to tell them we were coming..  13 minutes before departure.  And they told him no, not getting on the plane.  I arrived a few minutes behind him with a crying toddler.  I begged him to let us on.  Nope.  Not budging.

   In short, March 16 ATL to IAH at 7:55 pm delayed to the 10:25 pm flight (combining the two for whatever reason...money based most likely).
   10:25 flight - all boarded and ready; for us after sitting in airport six hours. Waited and waited until 30 minutes later we were told staff problems existed and the last flight to Houston for night was canceled.
   This is where it goes from bad to horrendous.
   Sure hundreds scrambled for assistance and we reached a long line as all restaurants, small shops closed up. Forty-five minutes later a staff member was trying to go down the line ""yelling information"".  
  Hotels were full, no option other than staying in the airport for the night if anyone wanted to catch the only flight at 6 am in which they could assure us a seat (all flights were full for the next day to IAH). 
   I confirmed that no hotel voucher was available; no hotel room was available as the Delta agent said 15 flights had canceled and rooms were full.
   We could have taken a taxi at midnight to a hotel in Buckhead, or surrounding area, but all on our own dime. And again, we had a seat now on the 6 am flight which Delta said to be at TSA three hours early due to the 15 canceled flights and crowds.
   We sat in Terminal A...all night. No blanket, no pillow. The terminal televisions blasted the stock reports, jazz music all night. A lady sat alone in a wheelchair, teen girls traveling alone appeared lost and afraid. A Japanese exchange student was alone and very confused. 
   About 12:30 am I approached the lone Delta customer service agent when a tiny elderly lady walked up asking for water to be flatly told NO. Not no I am sorry, just no. The water fountains did not work - only the personal bottle water dispenser if you had a cup. 
   It was an incredible slap in ways and one that is utterly wrong.
   I asked the agent to confirm my 6 am flight as my ticket still said 7:55 pm and I was losing all trust. She laughed in my face with a ""really"" you want me to print you a new ticket look. I proceeded to tell her it was my second ever DELTA flight and second time the flight had entirely canceled with the first time in the 80's.
   Her response - ""So you are telling me something about a flight from the 80's? Really?"" To my, ""yes I am because this has great impact now as it did last time"".
   She merely laughed and handed me my ticket.
   I lived through the night but at 68 years old, it was not easy.

We've been traveling for more than 50 years and know the drill. The day of the return flight we were tracking the incoming plane all morning and there seemed to be a problem but Delta kept saying everything was fine except when it wasn't. At MBJ was had to stand in line for 75 minutes to check in for FIRST CLASS! They lied all day and eventually began saying our departure would be delayed.

So we had to get our baggage and we were bussed to a very poor Holiday Inn. We were told to leave the hotel at 5:00 AM for a bus back to the airport where we had to wait in line for almost an hour, in an empty airport, to check in. The Delta and security people weren't there yet. No apologies. No food. Nothing. Then we had to wait until the 8:00 AM departure. Making us get there at 5:15 AM was the height of absurdity.

Today because of your horrific customer service:

My mother was disrespected in public by your rude employee. 

I lost $75 worth of gas

I lost $625 of potential income for the time I spent having to travel to and from unnecessarily due to your failure

I put just short of 500 miles on my car

My mother will not get to go see her first grandchild until we receive your ""possible"" refund in at the earliest 7 business days.....too bad this week was the only time available in our family's schedule.

However CDG is a horrible airport for connections. The passport control took way too long and we arrived at the gate exactly 7mn before departure time (10:25am) -- This is *before* not after departure time.  The staff member at the gate was rude and told us that the gate was closed and the plane is gone.  ``it is our rule to close the gate 20mn before the flight"" -- but they knew we were on our way and that the other plane had landed 1t 9:00am.  
I could see 3 of us in the same situation.  The other person had a long flight from India and started crying at the way she was treated by the ground personnel.  I know CGD tends to be like this - travelers are treated like cattle  really. But I expected a little better from Delta. Air-France re-booked our flight though Washington Dullles. But then when I boarded the plane in Dulles my boarding pass was rejected (my wife's was OK) - and then it took forever for the staff (at least 15mn) to fix the issue [I have not clue what the issue was - they did not care to tell me]. I was about the last to board the plane.

In any case here are my recommendations and comments if you go through CDG:

* Avoid CGD and choose Amsterdam Schiphol if at all possible [I missed at least 3 connections in the past couple of decades in CDG and *none* in AMS. If you you have a short connection in AMS due to a delay the ground personnel would have you skip the line. I was in this situation a couple of times and it helps. In Paris they tell you ``you will be fine"" and essentially shut you up.

* If you really have to go through CGD you need to plan for  at least 3h lay-over. [This  is a rule I use myself - but this time I thought this being a  low-season 2.5 hours were enough. Mistake]

* Expect rude treatment from personnel whether French ground personnel or Delta. Sorry but that is the way it is if you need to use CDG. I have  seen some improvements in the last 3 decades or so that I have been traveling overseas - but they are still far behind AMS.","terrible ground personnel - bad experience","false","false"

Over the years, our family has spent a fortune as loyal Delta customers. Tonight I was utterly devastated with the most horrible customer treatment ever. My wife is disabled and unable to walk for more than a few steps with help, and a came. Delta provided outstanding assistance in Jamaica, getting her on the plane and seated. We paid extra to accommodate her in the Comfort section of the aircraft, first on, first off etc. It is what we usually experience.
When we arrived at the gate tonight, no wheel chair assistance was provided at the gate. My wife was told to sit and wait until all the passengers deplaned and then they would see if they could find her a wheel chair. She was told by the first class cabin gentleman flight attendant sit there or just walk up the jet way. I spoke with an extremely insensitive person who appeared to be in charge of the replacing process and he stood at the entrance of the jet way. He told me that they have no staff to help disabled customers. He started that anyone with disabilites just had to wait as the don't want to bring wheelchais down to meet the customers as it may hinder replacing. WHAT!!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing from this totally insensitive human being. He should be fired!!!
After waiting until everyone got of the aircraft still no assistance. Just a whole lot of ridiculous rubbish from that gate agent.
1, Hanicapped people have to go last. 
2. We have no staff to Here help with wheelchair needy customers. 
3. He started that a 95 year old person fell on the jetway recently due to busy conditions so we don't want to bring wheelchairs until all other customers have made an exit.
We were not the only handicapped persons on that flight  that we're treated in this manner.
Eventually I left my wife by the plane and went up the getaway in search of a wheelchair. I found one and returned to my wife. I wheeled her myself all the way through passport controll, baggage and customs as well as struggling with four bags all the way out to curbside to our transportation home.
Delta YOU dropped the ball big time tonight. I'm so disappointed in the way your people treated us, and discriminated against customers with disabilaties.

I had a layover as I was traveling from PHL to ATL and then to ILM. I didn't know what I was in for! I arrived to Wilmington, North Carolina with only 2 out of 3 bags. When I was at the departure gate in PHL, the flight attendant informed me that my carry on luggage was not going to fit in the overhead bin and they were going to check it in as a courtesy. There was a family of three or four in front of me and they assumed I was with them and handed me over four different bag tags with her name ""Carissa Fleming"" meanwhile my name is Alejandrie Oviedo. I didn't realize this until i arrived in ILM and realized my bag was missing. I am confused as to why my name and my final destination was not verified to ensure this was being handled properly. As soon as I noticed, I filed a claim the same day and was informed that I would get my bag by 11PM. Bing that I had four baggage tags they were unsure which one was mine and so they just filed the claim under the first bag tagThe following day comes and I have yet to receive my bag so I contact baggage claim where they inform me that it was delivered to Nassau Bahamas baggage claim one and the next flight arriving to ILM will be for the following day. The following day came and still no bag so I went to the airport where they were unable to help me even after speaking to a supervisor. I spoke to about four people in baggage claim over the phone who reassured me that Bahamas have my bag and they will be sending it, but I still have not received it. I literally contacted delta daily and went to the airport daily in efforts to get my bag and I still have not received my bag. I have spoken to so many delta reps who have not been reassuring and this is my first time flying with Delta. I googled Delta to learn more about your baggage policies only to find out that you guys are ranked top 5 to lose people's luggages so of course I became more worried. I spoke to someone on 3/7/21 and this was the first time I was informed to file a loss bag claim when I should have been notified about this days ago. I am confused as to how it went from, ""I have your bag it's in the Bahamas, to we are going to deliver it tomorrow, to I spoke to a nice lady who said she was going to walk it over to customs to send to ILM, to we don't have your bag"" Delta is employing people who are stealing peoples luggages and this is insane. If you guys are known to lose luggages more diligent protective measures need to be put in place to ensure that people do not lose personal belongings. It is so unfair that this has caused my trip to be an inconvenience, no one in Delta cares and no one is on the same page, I am not receiving any updates or helpful information about my bag. I asked for the corporate office number and they were unable to provide me with that. I have things in my carry on luggage that money cannot buy, I have things that I have had for years that hold value to me, I have my home keys and my car keys which is going to make it harder for me when I return home. It is sad that because you guys are so used to losing people's bag that you don't care enough to take more steps to find lost luggages. You guys made a huge error and have not fixed it and so because of this experience I will not feel comfortable flying with you guys again. I am super sad, frustrated, annoyed, and I want to make sure no one else has to go through this. This is not how a business should be operating it is super illegal that you have people in Delta stealing luggages. I am unable to refuse that you guys made a huge error like this and in the process lost my bag. I JUST WANT MY BAG!

I'm writing this email to inform you that I am extremely disappointed for my upcoming trip for the following confirmation #'s - G8VELD, G8YYNZ & G765E8.  We are travelling as 3 adults, 2 children and an 8-month older toddler.

Our return flight home from CUN to JFK was originally scheduled at 4:28pm departure.  When booking our trip, we paid additional fees to upgrade our seats to Delta Comfort Class - Seats 11 A, B, C, D & F.  Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled so Delta changed our reservations to the 3:05pm flight, which is fine.  Upon the scheduling change we were place in Comfort class, and we were provided seats 11 D, E, F &   13 D & C.  

Earlier this week we were notified that Delta decided to take REMOVE us from the 3:05pm flight and reassign conf. # G8VELD and G765E8 to a connecting flight from Cancun to Minnesota to JFK (2 ADULTS).  Then the remaining passengers on conf. # G8YYNZ (1 ADULT, 2 KIDS and a TODDLER) from Cancun to Atlanta to JFK.

When calling Delta support, we were told the original 3:05 PM flight was NOT CANCELLED but we were REMOVED off the flight because the comfort class seats were only for money paying passengers and NOT AVAILABLE FOR PASSENGERS THAT purchased with Delta Sky Miles.  We were able to get back onto the 3:05pm flight but were assigned seats 33 A, B, C, D and E.  This is not what I call good customer service and I’m beyond frustrated and disappointed.

The first class experience was amazing on Delta and we got an American Express Delta card and flew both Alaska and Delta.

Delta's First Class is not even close to what it used to be, or needs to be. I write reviews to Delta when they send the option after our trips, I do not get any response and wonder why I write them. Also, getting through to someone to help you on the phone is nearly impossible. Yesterday, I had a 3.5 hour wait with no call back option? Not going to do that.

Delta, you need to take a hard look at your first class service, it feels like third class service (whatever that is). I do not feel like I am special, we worked hard to fly first class and spent many younger years in coach, if we pay for First Class, we should receive First Class service. And, when you have past service to compare current service to, it feels like you are being taken. Lower the cost, or get rid of the name First Class, call it bigger seat class, early boarding class etc.","Switched to Delta, not best choice","false","false"

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"We are extremely dissatisfied with our latest flight with Delta Airlines. We had traditionally had wonderful experiences with your airline but this flight was an exception to the rule. We departed from Providence, Rhode Island with an expected final destination in Nashville, TN. The issues began when we landed in LaGuardia, NY.

When we arrived at LaGuardia we were able to rush off the plane to get to our connecting gate prior to the specified time of departure. We had arrived with 8 minutes to spare. This is where we were greeted with hostility by Delta member at the gate. She had informed us that standby passengers had been given our seats and she was not going to call any crew member to open the jet bridge and let us on. She told us it was “Our fault we did not get there on time”. We were taken back on how rudely we were treated by this Delta crew member. Clearly, weather related issues can cause delayed flights, but this was in no way something we could control. We went to the information desk where another crew member couldn’t even understand why we were refused entry onto the plane.  

Delta had then oversold the next 2 flights out of LaGuardia for the day not allowing us an opportunity as standby passengers. This then would only leave us the opportunity to get another flight to Nashville the following day which would have put us into Nashville at after 3pm the next afternoon losing an entire other day and ½ our trip.

Because of this. We were forced to rent a car out of LaGuardia and drive 15 hours to Nashville.  After being at TF Green at 3am for a 5:20am flight we would not arrive in Nashville until being up for close to 24 hours and traveling across 7 states.","Rude crew member - overbooked flights","false","false"

She and Myra were absolutely hostile towards me in a condescending tone.  They do not belong  in the hospitality industry.

Delta stewardess generally act like very rude dictators. Yelling and pointing and demanding, ""Put that mask up right now!"" ""Get that mask over your nose now!"" ""You aren't taking a drink of your water now are you?"" ""Put your mask back on!!"" and it goes on and on. They are generally constantly looking around to see anyone slip their mask down to take a drink or a bite of food, and immediately, they started walking quickly down the aisle, toward the culprit to lecture him/her or to even yell at that person in front of everyone!! I do not know who died and made these stewardess's queen of the airways, but evidently someone did. But, two days ago, on a return flight on Delta, was the first time since this dumb pandemic, that the stewardess's did not do this. I did not hear any of them doing their usual yelling at passengers, or see them sashaying down the aisle quickly, to sternly warn a passenger. It was nice for a change. These airlines need to realize that we are all paying customers, who pay their salaries, and we are all human beings and that they are not the lords of rudeness. I have already decided not to fly Delta again, from too many past dictatorship experiences. Generally, No one on the plane who works there acts like they are even happy that you are their. Most of them act like it is such a bother to them that any one is aboard their plane.  The rudeness and yelling is quite unbearable and the throwing of luggage, when the loading workers load their planes, is ridiculous. I have had every piece of luggage I purchased, destroyed on the very first time used, by their cargo loaders.

Every other airline usually has a bulkhead between First Class and Premium Economy seats, but not Delta.  There were 3 rows of premium economy seats directly behind the 5 rows of First Class seats.  So why am I paying extra to be in the same smaller cabin with those who paid much less?  In addition, those 3 extra rows of economy seats, very narrow amd close together, made the front cabin feel very congested.

As for extra First Class amenities .... there were none.  The service received was no better than economy flights I had previously taken.  My child asked for apple juice, and they told us all they had was cranberry juice.  As for sodas, the choices were Coke, Diet Coke and Ginger Ale.  And on a 3+ hour flight, they never once asked if we wanted drink refills.

As for food, when our drinks were served, we got no snack.  Other airlines usually give you some trail mix or biscotti.  About an hour into the flight, they started food service, which consisted of a prepackaged box with a small sandwich, potato chips and a cookie.  We have had better food boxes in other airlines' economy classes than Delta's First Class offering on this trip.

I called the SkyMiles member number - a 1 hr 40 min wait.  Tried again the next morning - 2 hr 20 min wait.  I could not effect the change on the website, as I wanted to keep first class on one leg, and the website showed no first class option at all.

I see a lot of service issues posted, but scheduling hassles, cancelations, weather, etc. happens with all airlines... especially over the past month when there were a lot of staffing issues as airlines had to deal with those unvaccinated employees who were fired.  All in all, I've been choosing Delta over JetBlue to FLL (and I like JetBlue for their live TV and free internet) because in my particular situation:

> Deltq has CLEAR available at their terminal
> I receive FREE checked bags (2 for each in my party) 
> I am given priority seating, Comfort+, as an upgrade
> I am offered upgrade to First Class, based availability/priority basis
> Access to DL Airport Lounges

So, the perks outweigh the free internet and tv on JB.  On Delta, Live TV is variable and you have to pay for internet.  On todays flight, they had TV, but the screen wasnt great.  Some DL planes have nice, larger TVs... its a crapshoot and that is frustrating.  I did get access thru my phone to the TV, but that's a bit inconvenient... was happy to have it, don't get me wrong.

We are often forced to use Delta because their hub is in Michigan, and they are the only airline on the route we need during certain times of the year. When I can use Allegiant, I do, and making or cancelling a reservations takes like 10 minutes. With Delta, changing a reservation used to be impossible on line, because they didn't offer the option. You used to have to call and wait on line for like seriously 7 or 8 hours. Now you can change online, but it doesn't work often. They changed my flight time so it no longer works, but I have no way to back out of the ticket online, because the system is always down, to know what if any penalty there is, and no way to get anyone on the phone. Seriously, try to call them and sometimes you get a busy signal, sometimes they just say ""we aren't really taking calls right now,"" sometimes they ask for a number to call you back and you carry the phone around for a day but they don't ever call. Or if you are lucky you can hold all day. It's like you are in a developing world country. ARe they still an airline? I get the labor shortage, but this has been going on for a year: can't you fix your stupid website in a year??? I am stuck with all these credits on Delta, but I think I will go mad if I actually try to use them. Even just basic stuff, like you log onto the website to look at ""my trips"" but no, you still have to have your credit card, or reservation number (they sometimes don't email me my tickets, so this is a problem).

We purchased our tickets separately due to savings buying them that way but we were seated together.  Didn’t know I should have called Delta so they could link the seats, my ignorance.  Customer service was able to find us two seats sitting together in the front row of premium economy which my husband insisted we avoided when I first bought them due to no under-seat storage.  CS said they were the only two seats in PE and that the flight was full so it was it that or sit separately.  I have a fear of flying so having him near me settles my fears.  Personally I like the extra leg room but I get his preference as he likes to have easy access to his backpack.  So to me this wasn’t a big deal but then our seats didn’t recline, both of them didn’t.  Then I look around our aisle and see the other seats in the center and other side of the plane are reclining, so our seats are broken which is why I guess our two seats were the last seats.  Then my TV didn’t work either, constantly freezing that I could no longer have it on.  It was really uncomfortable and painful on our backs trying to sleep (got no sleep really) in seats that don’t recline.  We had plans to drive 4+ hours once we landed, so it was a really bad experience on Delta.

I didn’t get an email or text or alert when they cancelled. I just had to stumble onto their app. I already had a boarding pass both times.

My flights were cancelled 6 hours before a 6am flight, and 2 hours before a 2 pm flight. I had international connections to make not booked through Delta. I luckily lived close enough to take an expensive multi hour Uber, but absolutely no planning or notification when it happened both legs of the trip left me scrambling.

They did rebook me after a delay, but both times it was for a flight literally days later so that didn’t work. There was nothing closer apparently.

Trying to get my money back required waiting in a phone queue for EIGHT HOURS. I tried the texting service and also had to wait about 9 hours before I finally got a real person… who then told me they couldn’t do anything and I had to call. I was unable to do anything self service through the website, of course, which is why I had to call in the first place.

I ended up waiting for the phone again, getting someone nice, and getting their help to get money back but it’s been a week and I still don’t have a refund. I had to carefully say I didn’t want e credit too, as they push it aggressively. If I wanted a simple flight change in those 2 hours, I wouldn’t have been able to talk to someone.

I never heard this until a few days before it happened for our first time.

On Nov 27, 2021, three of us flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Birmingham, AL.
The flight leaving FLL was delayed about an hour. In ALT we had to hurry to make our flight to BHM. At baggage claim waiting for our luggage we heard our name announced over the intercom system to report to Baggage Claim Office. 

Guess what? “Delta” had happened. 

The representative had informed us that 5 pieces of luggage had been delayed about an hour and a half, and 1 piece would not be there until the next morning. The time is approximately 9:30 PM, the representative asked if we were staying at a nearby hotel, and we said ‘yes’ an informed her of where. 

She told us that the hotel was on her way home and with our permission she would drop the 5 pieces of luggage off on her way home. She also gave us detailed instructions on how to get the 1 piece coming in the next day.

We want to thank Ava Story from the bottom of our hearts for everything she did for us that evening. This proves there are caring people still in this world.

"Desktop","1","review","4",,"So, our Friday night flight was cancelled.  After over an hour on the phone to find a new flight, the only option available was Monday night - 3 days later.
By the time we got to the baggage claim, no bags.  Walked to ticket counter - no bags and no Delta Employee.  Our ride was waiting, so we left without our 6 checked bags.
We returned to the airport in the morning to get our bags, my husband waited in the car, so he could drop me right at the bag claim.  I was told at the unclaimed bag desk that because our flight was cancelled, our bags would have been kept at the ticket counter.  
I walked to to the ticket counter, and had the unfortunate experience of having to work with Dwayne.  Dwayne, the Delta employee at the Spokane Airport ticket counter was the most condescending and unhelpful person I have encountered recently.  Dwayne should not “work” (if you can call what he does for customers work) in a service position.
I am wearing a beanie and a big jacket and his first response to me was “oh my God, you scared me”.  He then looked down at the luggage cart I’d brought with me for 6 bags and said, “what is that?”
I let him know I was hear to pick up my bags, as our flight was cancelled.  He then talked to me like I was a child, informing me that “bags aren’t collected here”.
I explained, again, the situation.  I explained that I had already been to baggage claim, that I had talked with someone at the baggage counter who called someone at the ticket counter to confirm the bags would be here.  He then asked me for my confirmation number, which I had on my Delta App and gave him.  He then asked for my baggage claim  tracking number, which I didn’t have on me.
Dwayne finding a perfect opportunity to not be helpful or do his job held up a random baggage ticket sticker, tapped on it for me, I’m case I didn’t see it being held in front of my face, and said that I needed to provide him this ticket, which I would have been given if I checked my bags.  I told him, again, I don’t have it on me.  I then asked, if he has my name, my tracking number, and someone has confirmed our bags are here, why do I need it.  To which he said, “It is going to make it easier for me to find your bags.”  
I asked him what he would do if I had lost it (I knew it was in my carry on in the car), he said that it would be harder to find my bags then.  I asked him to do it the “hard” way then, which was literally walking back to the place they would store bags for folks whose flights were cancelled, and he replied, “could you just go get the bag confirmation, please”.  I said, “so you aren’t going to help me unless I walk all the way back to the baggage claim car waiting area and get this stupid ticket”.  And he literally mmmhmmmd me.  The sound, “mmmhhhhmmm” was his response to me.

So, I walked BACK down to the baggage claim, met my husband, got the ticket, and my husband joined me back inside to deal with Dwayne, cause I would not be spoken to that way again.  We waited in line for ten minutes to get back to the PRIORITY counter, and we were greeted by Dwayne asking “did you get it?  Did you get it?”  My husband handed Dwayne the baggage tracking tickets, and Would you be surprised to hear that Dwayne did NOTHING with them but COUNT them.  No scan, no look up the super special bag tracking number in the system to solve the mystery of where our bags were, nope!  None of that.  He just COUNTED them and asked, “so, six bags”?  Then walked down the hallway to where they put bags and AMAZING!!  The magic tickets led him to where our bags were.

Good Job, Delta.  I can’t wait to watch another preflight video where you tell me all the wonderful things you are doing to make my travel safe and comfortable - clearly that is a lie.

Cancelled flight to Anchorage that we have the “luxury” of rebooking FOUR days later, )250 a day in accommodations gone, but hay - your supervisor said they were real sorry, and I could leave my complaints at www.delta.something, all because the pilot of a delta plane couldn’t land in fog.  Yet, crazy, every other airline coming into the same airport landed…..
So, if not your reliability, if not your customer service, one would think we could rely on Delta for pilot capability - Apparently not.

No points, no comps for late, delayed, and cancelled time, no give two cares from Delta other than our rebooking to our destination 4 days later.

PS - no luggage.  Reason given “we are so behind and short staffed that by the time we get it back to you, it will be after your delayed flight”.  Well, ya know, maybe tell us that before we spend 40 minutes waiting at the luggage return…

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"I am upset that the numerical criteria do not allow me to reflect how I actually feel. The rating seems to be geared entirely around the experience on the aircraft, which was an admittedly fine experience. The issues I have with Delta were the entire rest of the experience.

The mobile app looks and functions terribly. I have flown on most major airlines as I travel a great deal for work and scheduling is often more important than brand loyalty. This is the worst app I have used. The mobile ticket on the route to location did not function at all. Said I couldn't check in and would not display my boarding pass. So I had to show up early to the airport to get my ticket from the agent. This is where the second issue shows up.

The Delta staff in each of the 4 different airports I visited were collectively the least helpful employees I have ever worked with. I have never seen a collective workforce seemingly intent on not helping as I did with Delta. I show up to the airport at 3:30 AM as my international flight leaves at 6:00 AM. There is already a line of 20 or so people at the Delta check in location as there is not one employee. When we finally see one at 4:00 AM he is walking slowly through the line asking each one of us where we are flying. After all of that he stands in front and just starts yelling for international flights to form one line, flights to Denver to form a different one, and so on. This would be great except he is still the only person here. So now we are just waiting in different lines. Finally a wave of 4 people come out and start taking customers. This is very slow and the ilne has continued to grow and is now probably 200 people. 3 more people show up and just stand behind the four working. There are plenty of open stations, but we now have 4 people helping customers and 4 people watching. Three presumed managers and the line maker.

Get to the line and my wife and I are only given one of our tickets, but we are told that we will get our next ticket in Salt Lake. Make it through to my flight with about 20 minutes to spare, but I am TSA Precheck. I feel sorry for the 20 or so International passengers behind me who may or may not have been.

Arrive at our first layover in Salt Lake and head right to the gate to get our tickets. We are told we are not on this flight. That is probably the reason they could not print our second ticket, but why solve that probably in Portland when you could push it to an employee in Salt Lake? Perfect. To their credit I did interact with the solely helpful employee in Salt Lake. I wish I had time to catch her name, but she moved us onto a flight that was currently boarding so we ran to that flight and are on the way to Mexico.

As we sit down we realize that our checked luggage is probably not making it. We asked one of the flight attendants who directed us to the app to track our bag, which claims it is still in Portland. She tells us not to worry and it will be there when we land. It was not.

We are told it is still in Salt Lake when we land in Cancun and it will be here sometime. They think tomorrow. It did indeed show up the next day. Luckily my wife and I packed a day's worth of clothing in our carry on.

Now we fly back. Mobile app issues again. I can only get ONE of our boarding passes. My boarding pass says I need to complete check in, but when I try and complete check in it says I have completed it. Great. Back to the airport early to deal with this. I am told that the two legs of my flight are somehow on different reservations because I changed my flight? I told them I did nothing of the sort and I got a notification the day before that Delta delayed my layover. They tell me I did something wrong while changing it so I can only get one ticket again. I am told to go to my gate when I land and get my new ticket. Fine.

Then we get to the gate and my Wife’s mobile ticket now says “Too close to boarding time. Ticket unavailable” WHEN ELSE WOULD I NEED MY TICKET? So now during boarding we are standing in line at the gate to print HER ticket. Scanned and she is in. They scan my ticket and I am not on this flight. Another employee slamming away at a computer for 2 minutes and I am back on the flight. I am sure we will have no issues in Atlanta.

Arrive in Atlanta and go to my gate as instructed, granted we are 3 hours before boarding at this point, and stand in front of the employee sitting there:

Me: Hello!
Delta Employee: Hi.
M: How is it going today?
D: How can I help you?
M: I was unable to get my second ticket in Cancun was told to get my ticket here
D: Someone will be here one hour before boarding and you will get your ticket.
M: I was told to get it as soon as I landed. I have had a few issues with me not being on certain flights this trip and would like to just have my ticket in hand. They gave me my ticket number
D: Someone will be here one hour before boarding to help you.
M: You are here right now, can we not just print it now so if there is an issue I could handle it?
D: No. Someone will be here-
M: Fine thank you so much you have been a huge help

I did get my ticket and I was on the flight. So there was no issue, but I cannot believe how difficult and tedious it was navigating the Delta experience. Their planes are fine. Their Flight Attendants are pleasant. Their snacks are standard. They are a perfectly normal airline in the air, but the interactions I had with the staff in the airport were all terrible. I found myself shaking my head and questioning how they could be awarded #1 in customer satisfaction in 2021. I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt in Portland with short staff and an early morning. But every single employee I talked to in airports was so annoyed that I talked to them and pointed out the issues I was having. As I mentioned I fly a lot and almost never need to interact with the staff in airports, but the few times I have with other airlines have all been at least pleasant. I have had flights delayed, and switched and I don’t really care. So long as I get to my destination I understand stuff happens. I just cannot believe how troublesome it was to get my questions answered.

I mentioned above that I don’t have brand loyalty and typically fly whichever flight is at a convenient time, but I will now filter our Delta flights.","I am upset that the numerical criteria do not allow me to reflect how I actually feel","false","false"

Boy, did they drop the ball on my last flight.

I and my companion were taking a connecting flight from Atlanta to Richmond, when moments before boarding, I noticed that the seat number on my electronic boarding pass had changed. Both of us are large men, so I booked, and paid extra for, selected seats, across the aisle from each other, near the middle of the plane. Suddenly, I'd been reassigned a window seat in the tail section. After the first couple of boarding classes had embarked, it was announced that there was no available room in overhead bins, and all remaining passengers must check their carry-on luggage. This newer aircraft has the enlarged overhead bins, in which there are large diagrams showing how the bin can accommodate five bags if they were turned on their side, but none on the cabin crew were directing passengers to stow their luggage in this space-efficient manner. By the time the back third of the plane was boarding, the rear overhead bins were nowhere near capacity. From my cramped window seat in row 30, I could see that not one of the bins from rows 26-33 was half full; if they'd been properly loaded with bags turned on their side, none of these bins would have been more than a third full. Waiting for my carry-on at the baggage claim meant my ride from the airport was circling the terminal for another 20 minutes. I'm aware that cabin crew aren't compensated for time on during the boarding process, but whether it was expedience or laziness that led to these lapses in customer service, my impression of Delta isn't the same.","Delta had become my go-to airline, but this last experience gives me pause","false","false"

According to Delta's website, the experience - beside the extra seat-features - will include designated flight attendants, premium meals and spirits and so on. I watched some you tube reviews that also convinced me for this upgrade, which cost me $700. Once on board, I found out that there are no designated flight attendants, and we were served the exact same meal as the main cabin was. Most of the crew were grumpy and intending. They were hanging out in the back, no one came to check up on us. I asked one of the attendant, what is the ""Experience"" include. She said the seat and the amenity kit.
The seat is not comfortable, the headrest is sticking out, keeping your back bended for the whole time - unless you can score like 3 pillows for support. If you are tall, the leggiest won't do anything for you. The amenity kit is a retarded delta one kit that definitely not worth the money.
I know, I know, don't get me wrong. I'm not a 'Karen'. I'm also aware that these are not usual times, flight attendants are overworked and underpaid.

I'm fine with standing in line for an hour and a half to check in because I understand Covid restrictions and absentees. Actually, even the passengers who had missed flights because of the line were being patient and understanding. But Delta employees should do all they can to help and alleviate stress, not yell at passengers who have missed flights and refuse to help. 

I had booked a flight on the Delta website but apparently it hadn't been ticketed. I had an email itinerary that told me I was booked but the supervisors told me I had no ticket as if I had done something wrong. (The man who initially helped me was very kind. It was the supervisors who were cruel, particularly the main supervisor.) They refused to help and lectured me until I begged them in tears. They finally issued a ticket minutes before I had to board, and I had to run all the way through that large airport to my plane. I was the last person to board.

Why? Aren't Delta supervisors there to help customers? Or are they doing us a favor by allowing us to fly their airline?

I was then put on standby from MSY to JFK to BOS, managed to get on that flight to JFK, and was supposed to have a 6 hour layover--I was able to switch to a 6:30 PM flight to BOS so I wouldn't be getting home at 11 PM, and was told by the Delta employee who rebooked me that my flight would be protected--that flight was then cancelled, and I was told I could not even get on the standby list for the 8:59 PM flight to BOS that I had switched from.

Delta said I had to have checked it at least 45 minutes prior and it was now 43 minutes prior to my flight.  I asked if they was any wiggle room in the rule as my daughter would be waiting at the Vegas airport for me.  Delta said no, get on that line and book another flight.  I even asked if they could send my luggage on a later flight & I would pick it up at the airport but they soid they couldn't do that. As you wil see, they did exactly that.  So they said the next flight they could put me on would get me into Vegas @ 10:43pm which would mean my daughter would be waiting there for about 13 hours. I said is there anything earlier. They said no, so I paid almost $100 extra to be put on the late flight and was no longer comfort plus.   So with time on my hands I got on my computer and found out the Delta agent had lied to me. There was an earlier flight that would get me to Vegas at 6:23pm.  So after considerable effort on my part doing an online chat with Delta I was able to get on an earlier flight. When I went to check my bag for the afternoon flight I had to pay another $30 baggage fee.  I spoke to an agent and said I had already paid and I have a record of it.  They said they had no record.  Clearly lying again or just incompetent or did not care. (I have both $30  charges on my credit card company statement).  Then...

I was hoping they would bring me my bag that night or early the next morning as everything I needed was in it.  Warm jacket, hiking boots, etc.  Well....I didn't get my bag until around 4pm the next day.  So that day was ruined.

Granted, they can't control the weather, but they could have done a better job anticipating the flight loads and time of year.

So on some flights my retired Navy spouse with 24 years of service may get to pre-board and on others he may not?    And this Is subject to the gate attendant? There should be a consistent policy.  Pensacola has a large military presence both active duty and retired and it was because of this,  I was  also told that retired military were not allowed to pre-board.  To which I replied. “ Thank God for them”.","Military pre-boarding  inconsistency continues","false","false"

The flight attendant was attentive for the first hour but needed to be called for service beyond that since she was on the phone for the remainder of the flight. The salmon salad had a large amount of salmon lox but very little greens. It included green beans and potato slices that seem a little odd for a salad  but it was okay. For drinks the options were very limited. The only whiskey type options were Jack Daniel's and Woodford so I had a couple Woodfords over the 3 hour flight. Upon arrival we decided since we were flying first class we should check into the delta lounge to see what was available. Unfortunately, like the wifi on flights which they claim to provide, you are required to pay extra for that service. Since this used to be a service that was part of first class and because United airlines still provides this amenity as part of first class flights I recommend booking through united. I would also suggest booking through any other service because delta no longer deserves to be supported based on the level of greed they show.","No reason to pay for any amenities","false","false"

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"Been flying Delta for 30 years. I’ve watched them go from a personalized customer centric  airline to a corporate behemoth that herds people in and out of their planes like sheep. Then they pack you in like a can of sardines. Their focus are the Diamond medallion customers and their on time ratings. Economy fliers boarding last with carry on bags get in the way of the goals of the airline. The fares paid are cheaper and they can hinder the main goal of each flight…close the door and pull back from the gate…on time. 

The city of Atlanta runs the airport. They have allowed Delta a monopoly and they work together to limit competition through gate limitations and services they provide to other airlines. Delta lobbies the state against any addition regional airports. They protect each other, more money flows their way and the sheep get squeezed tighter. 

Our latest and most infuriating experience magnified the situation. Arrived and checked bags 2 hours early as dictated by the airport and Delta. Security check line serpentine through baggage claim and we were herded back and forth by the barking airport dogs nipping at our feet.  1 hour and 50 minutes later we get through security and run to our gate arriving 10 minutes BEFORE take off.  Gate agent informed us we were late and they gave our seats away. He insisted it was our fault and they have the right to do this 15 minutes prior to take off.  The 4 other flights to PIT were all over booked. We were offered a standby slot behind 33 other people!

Delta got what they wanted. A full flight and an on time departure. Airport is able to claim they are the worlds largest moving the most passengers.

The first class seats were the biggest disappointment.  Our flight took off at 9pm from Kona so we were really hoping to get some sleep in the first class section.  The seats are quality leather, but our seats padding felt extremely worn and we could feel the support bars underneath.  They also don't recline enough to actually get comfortable enough to sleep.

At this point I’m exhausted and just want to go home, so I sit patiently at the gate where I waited hours to board my flight, because of other delays and because the pilots were not there yet. But again, I didn’t care because I wanted to go just home and rest. At landing, upon turning my phone on, I receive a text saying my 2 checked bags didn’t make it to Phoenix. Only thing is I have 3 bags, and one is unaccounted for. The big yellow priority tags didn’t matter to Delta or anyone at ATL I guess. At baggage claim I’m told that it’s all my fault because I didn’t pick them up during the layover to get them to customs… but wait, I was also told to get them at destination, since this trip was all Delta operated and booked in one reservation. Turns out they did go to customs, but the people at ATL didn’t bother to put them on the next flight. We were able to locate the third bag, which was never scanned, therefore couldn’t show up in the system. A big mess. Today I was excited to see that they were on a flight to Phoenix and was ready to go pick them up. But wait. They have been “removed planeside”. I don’t know what to do but one thing I know. I will never fly Delta again especially Delta One. The only “One” thing they’ll get is the one star review I’m about to leave.

I flew NWA with platinum status until Delta bought them, and then quality of service continued to tank;  I did have Delta Platinum before bailing....

For this trip, so far, Denver check in was great, boarding was hectic not allowing 1st class to board until after droves of others already had, then they blur the lines based on status too, resulting in a hoard of people jamming to get in first.

In Atlanta, it degraded from hectic to absolute chaos as if the gate had never boarded a plane before.

Further, Covid Cr4p or not, what happened to beverages as 1st class settles in? No booze, no problem,  how about a coffee at 6am? By noon? Offer a drink!

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Awful experience. Flight MSP to BHAM, flew with one bag I planned as a carry-on - on boarding, they said they overbooked the flight and they would have to check bags. I asked if there was any way I could bring my bag on board, as I had a medical device in there I needed with me for getting to my connecting flight at ATL. Delta staff at MSP raised their voices at me and told me I had to check my bag, but that it would be ON THE CONCOURSE at ATL. I thought this unusual, but I believed them! So I fly to ATL and hobble down to the concourse, where I ask baggage claim about it - they say that it would go straight to BHAM, as I expected. Now with limping down to baggage claim and back, I missed my connecting flight. Talked to service desk, was told the next few flights were sold out. So, I drive down to my destination the next day after having to stay in a hotel. Spent hours on the phone attempting to confirm if my bag was, in fact, in BHAM. No luck - a couple of dead end lines, and then getting incorrect numbers from delta staff and being transferred to wrong depts. No info.
After all this, I was mad, but I thought ""It's fine, I'll deal with it. I got to my destination in time and I still have a flight home."" Boy, was I wrong! Due to me missing my connecting flight (because of Delta's misinformation), Delta cancelled my flight back, but didn't let me know until the night before when I checked in! I had been checking the app daily to make sure my return flight hadn't been changed, and everything looked good on there until I checked in, where an automated pop-up said that I violated their no-show policy and that my flight would be cancelled. Then it deleted all of my flight information! Luckily I still had the confirmation number on my baggage, that I had to drive to Birmingham airport to get. I ended up splitting the trip back riding with a couple of people and taking a Greyhound, adding days and stress onto my trip.

Not only was my flight experience horrible, with getting incorrect information from delta staff, but trying to get any help took over 2 months and well over 15 hours on the phone and emailing. At the end of it, the travel problems Delta caused cost me hundreds of dollars up front and even more in lost wages, and after months of being passed around and ignored, they gave me a $25 travel voucher.

Up until recently, I would convince anyone in a 50m radius to do the same. Here is the reason why their new approach to customer service has moved me away from them.

In the last 6 months there has been a significant downgrade in their level of support. A live example - 8 of us were flying to Costa Rica and of course I convinced the crew to all fly delta even though American was cheaper. They changed the flight weeks from time we were suppose depart and the change left a 20 minute layover in ATL. I called to see if the flight needed to be moved and was told that Delta would change their flight again and to wait. You guessed it, the flight was not changed. I called again and was told if I stay on this flight I would miss my layover and the next flight goes out the following day. After hours of back and forth, we came to the conclusion that the group of us would have to fly in a day early and get a hotel and that “Delta would take care of you”. I called the group and we moved our flights and then I called back to get confirmation and was told they would not compensate us for the hotel because “this is not a Delta issue it is a flight change”. We all had to pay for a hotel which not only did we pay more for our flights because of our loyalty but now we incurred an additional expense directly related to Delta because of a flight change.

A couple of weeks before the flight Delta Airlines decided on their own to change our itinerary which caused problems with layovers and caused confusion with the travel agency. We were made to pay for this flight change even though we did not request the change or risk losing out on the nearly $3500 we paid for round trip tickets. 2) Check in was offensively dramatic and excessive with the nonsense covid restrictions. On the way back from Frankfurt I was literally checked 6 times to verify passport, vaccine, and negative test results between initial check-in and getting on the actual aircraft. (I realize some of that is the airport itself and not the airline. 3) Cramped...I'd almost rather travel by boat for two weeks to Europe on future vacations, the legroom and arm-room is absolutely horrendous for the amount of money you pay to fly regardless of whether or not you sit in coach or are even lucky enough to land a seat in business class where you might get an extra inch or two of space. I imagine equal comfort in the back of a cattle truck. 4) The constant reminders while onboard the aircraft to stay masked or face removal from the aircraft, a lifetime ban from flying with Delta, and potential federal criminal charges was so excessive (nearly every hour on the hour) that it bordered psychological-operations. You can't get on the plane without proving you've been vaccinated and have tested negative within 3 days of your flight so literally every soul onboard is covid free which begs the question whether masks are even necessary to begin with, but that aside I understand the need for rules...having those rules constantly bombarded at me over the course of a 9 to 10 hour flight is both excessive and ridiculous.

Initially, I was remote, but when the office opened up, my company wanted me to move there. I obliged, packed up all of my clothing in a suitcase and headed out west. My trip was a flight from DCA to ATL to SNA with an hour long layover in Atlanta. Long story short my bag did not make it on my flight to Southern California. After filing a claim, waiting many days, and checking in on my own every day (delta never reached out), I filed the missing luggage form, and claimed a value of ~$3,600 dollars. This value was based on the new value of my entire wardrobe that I had itemized on the claims form. Days later, I received an email saying that I would only be refunded 25% of my claimed value, since I could not provide individual receipts for clothes I have purchased over the past 5+ years. 

 Considering that Delta 

1. Lost the bag and couldn’t recover it.

2. Has a maximum claim value policy of $3800

3. Never stated that only 25% would be recognized

"Desktop","1","review","2",,"I purchased my 1st Class round trip ticket (G48QJO) for $1446.40 on 06/24/21.  My flights to LAS went fine, however I was called by one of your representatives @ 1:04PM on Sept. 9th and informed that I no longer had a confirmed seat on my scheduled return flight #836 LAS-ATL on 9/11/21, as it had been given up for reasons beyond our control and they wanted to move me to a later flight with only a 30 min. layover in ATL.  How was it beyond their control as they manage the seat assignments?  Did God intervene?  I said that was unacceptable and that I would have to call back as I was in a meeting.  When I checked my Delta app later, I had been moved to the later flight with an unassigned seat and a connecting flight with no seats available.  Your Android app would not let me change the reservation, so I booked another return ticket while I waited 1 hr 45 minutes on hold for one of your reps, then spent another 45 re-booking the flights which caused me to now leave 2 hrs earlier and spend 3 1/2 hrs on a layover in ATL. 

The agent then offered me a 5,000 mileage credit for the inconvenience, which is ridiculous, as my time is far more valuable than the equivalence of $50 and I feel I deserve a refund of at least half the price of my ticket ($723).  When I did eventually arrive back in CHS and retrieved my $200 hard side Samsonite luggage, I discovered that the lock had been damaged and looked like it had been hit by a hammer.  It had been damaged to the point the lock no longer functioned and I had to pry my suitcase open with a screwdriver.  I keep receiving messages from Capt. Patrick Burns welcoming us back to flying, but if this is how they treat your 1st class passengers, I shudder to think what economy passengers are experiencing.

From changing prices for flights, making the bereavement flight very difficult, having me on hold for seven hours total trying to charge me for a flight fees that they broadcast as being waived during bereavement flights. 

Your desk agent in Buffalo is responsible for me missing my very first flight and is responsible for my sisters finding out that their father is dead without me being there. They kept me in line so long that the doors to my flight closed all because the agent was incompetent and took 30+ minutes/ the help of two others in order to change the boarding pass printer paper on one machine instead of moving to another machine and taking care of his guests. I want to be clear, it was NOT busy and he kept taking breaks to talk to his coworker. So I missed my flight and was charged to have it changed and even had to take a connecting flight at jfk( which I fell while trying to make it in time making my trip even worse) because I have three spinal issues and can not move around as easily. I even told delta this and they told me that it didn’t count as one of their disabilities and handed me the paper to call to change my flight. The guy was so freaking rude. 
 During the time waiting for my first flight , standing in the line so long caused my disc to slip out of place and I had been in excruciating pain the entire time of my initial journey. Once again I reached out to try and get the service for disabled people as I saw them escorting other disabled people to their gates in chairs to help them protect themselves against further injury. Yet, once again I was denied. (I have three spinal disorders that prevent me for standing or sitting for too long without pain. Hence why I made the request so many times) 

And don’t get me started on how crappy your phone systems are. You made coordinating flights for my grandparents a NIGHTMARE . Between myself and my parents we had to have spent $3000 on flights with you guys over the last week and a half and Jesus Christ if I could go back in time get a refund and go to another airline I would because this was the WORST experience I ever had while flying. 

I have to fly back and forth to atl over the next two months and based on this experience and the experiences of my grandparents who also flew with you this week…im most likely gonna find an airline that is true to their word and prioritizes the health and safety of their disabled and grieving passengers. 

If you have any further questions feel free to contact me as I STILL didn’t get the call back from the customer service supervisor that I was promised days ago after I waited on hold for 50 minutes.

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"Here's the problem I have. When I booked the flight I feel the price was fair for what I paid; a flight from Minneapolis to Istanbul with a stop in Amsterdam on the way there and a stop in Paris on the way back. 1 layover each way. We all know if a consumer changes their flight the airline will charge them. In this case they changed my flight on the way back to 2 stops with an additional stop in Atlanta adding 7 hours of flight and layover time to my travels.  I am aware of the issues with Covid. That is not the issue. My issue is they changed the return flight so close to travel that it would be impossible for me to reschedule back to a one-stop flight with that little time and Secondly, when they did this they offered no compensation in airline credit or a partial refund which they should have. If a consumer must pay to change a flight then an airline needs to compensate when they do not provide the service a  consumer paid for. i.e adding 7 hours of flight and layover time. When I booked the flight it was a fair deal. After they added the extra stop it was an over-priced flight which I was forced to use. 

The meals were also extremely sugary and salty and the seats were less comfortable  than American and Southwest

"Desktop","1","review","1",,"I can't even begin to relay how frustrating and disappointing this entire weekend was because of how badly our travel plans were screwed up. This turned into the most stressful, costly, and time consuming travel interruption I have ever experienced in the 34 years I've been flying. 
Starting with our flight being cancelled while we waited at the airpot at our gate due to the ""internal server outage"" which caused us to have to scramble to book another flight that in order to make it to Albuquerque in time for a wedding that we were in. First we were offered zero help with finding alternative travel plans and left to choose between an hour and a half long line at the airport or a 3 hour hold time over the phone with Delta. No indication we would be refunded or accommodated in any way in the cancellation email. Just ""your flight is cancelled, sorry"". The one way tickets to ABQ cost us $270 each which is almost triple half of our roundtrip tickets that were under $200 total each. 
When I spoke to someone via Delta chat/text I asked for a refund to be processed for the cancelled portion of our flight but was VERY specific about the fact that we STILL NEEDED OUR RETURN FLIGHT from ABQ to LAX. When the agent came back hours later she said ""your refund is being processed in the amount of $196.80 each"" which is the full price of our round trip ticket. I said that can't be correct and asked if our return flight was still in place. Her response was that I asked for a refund which you can see in the attached screenshots was 100% NOT the case. She then said ""let me see if I can fix it"" and proceeded to NEVER COME BACK. 
This set into motion a huge chain of Delta agents repeatedly dropping the ball throughout my entire weekend while I spent over 8 hours trying to reach SOMEONE who could confirm that we still had a flight back to LAX. I got 4 or 5 different agents on chat, some of whom asked what I needed help with and then never responded to my immediate responses, some of whom I explained the whole scenario to who said the would look into it and also NEVER RETURNED. 

All indications via the Delta app and using our confirmation code online were that our flight was in place. It wasn't until I wait over 3 hours on hold on the phone while I was supposed to be spending time with friends and family I haven't seen in years that I got someone who informed me that my whole round trip flight was cancelled and that the agent I originally spoke to should have told me that it is not possible to cancel part of a round trip flight in the first place. I was then told that because I booked this trip through Chase I needed to contact them. I never spoke to Chase about cancelling the flights nor did the original agent EVER mention that I needed to contact Chase. 
Called Chase, waited on hold, they told me the whole round trip had been cancelled and my only option was to rebook at the current higher price which would have me pay THE SAME PRICE as my ENTIRE round trip just for our one way back to LAX. To which I told them absolutely not. I wait ANOTHER 2 hours on hold to FINALLY get a Delta agent on the phone who was the ONLY person in this process to actually be remotely helpful. She spoke to a couple people, ran into a dead end, and waited for an appropriate supervisor for over an hour while I sat on hold. She then was told that nothing could be reversed and again my only option was to book a new flight at double the cost and file a complaint afterward. This was all about an hour before we were supposed to be boarding our return flight almost leaving us stranded an additional night in ABQ with that added expense. 
I am also out a non-rufundable night stay of $132 for the Thursday night hotel we booked the night of 10/21/21. So all in all we are out an additional $900+ for extra ground transportation, cancelled hotels, cancelled rental car, and additional flight costs in order to make it to our destination and back. I am BEYOND appalled at how many times Delta service completely failed leaving us in a stressful lurch with no option but to spend hours of our weekend trying to reach customer service and dealing with people who did not help.","Honeslty the WORST travel experience I have had to date.

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"A dog suffered and died while in the cabin of this flight. I am a Registered Nurse and I work in a large inner-city, level 1 trauma center. I have been working the frontlines against this COVID-19 nightmare since the beginning and our trip to Puerto Rico was planned to be a much-needed getaway. 

Some background on the situation: There were a pair of individuals that spoke minimal English. They had a French bulldog that they brought in a small carry-on container to keep underneath the seat. As we were boarding, one of the flight attendants told the male individual to open up the carrier so the dog could get some air, because the dog was panting very loudly and sounded like it was distressed. Thankfully, I was not aware of this background information or this situation would have been way more heartbreaking for me. 

About 2 1/2 hours into the direct flight, the flight attendants announced an overhead page asking if there were any medical personnel on board that could assist. A physician and I came to help and saw that the medical emergency was with this dog. We were told that ""we have a dog that is not responsive"". Between myself and the Spanish-speaking flight attendant, we were able to ascertain that the male individual noticed that the dog had not been moving in the carrier for the last 10-15 minutes and so he lifted the carrier up to check on the dog. The dog was not moving- no breathing, no heartbeat, the dog's eyes were stuck halfway open. 

The physician and I knew it did not look good. I asked for them to grab us some oxygen, and I ran back to my seat to grab a blanket I brought so that the two of us could lift the dog out of the carrier and onto the empty row of seats immediately in front of them. The dog was drenched in sweat. This is very alarming because dogs typically do not sweat. Also alarming- I immediately recognized that this was a bulldog breed and these breeds commonly have breathing problems that result in trouble cooling down. The male said that they had given a small sedative that they had first tried earlier in the week and had no concern with.

Essentially, the physician and I did full-on CPR to the best of our ability, but the dog was deceased the moment we set eyes on it. The dog was only 1 year and 4 months old. This dog had no previous medical concerns. I pounded on that dog’s chest, desperately trying to get his heart pumping again. I turned the oxygen on full blast and held his airway open while trying to dry him off with my blanket.

One of the worst parts of this experience is the memory of trying to fit the dog back into the carrier after we determined that we couldn't save him. THE DOG WOULDN'T FIT. We had to push his head down while someone else helped to zip the carrier up. Later at baggage claim, we saw the pet carrier stored underneath the female passenger's airport-provided wheelchair. There were bags on top of it. This dog was discarded like trash.

I couldn't eat for the first 36 hours of this trip. I was having really bad stomach upset and panic attacks. I wanted to go home. I kept thinking of the terror that this dog went through during the first 2 hours of the flight and how completely terrified he must have felt. I have been acting as a surrogate family member for the past 16 months for my dying COVID-19 patients in the hospital, yet this is the experience that gives me nightmares. 

On the 5th day of the trip, I decided to look further into the Delta pet policy, and I was truly shocked when I found how clearly the policy states that bulldog breeds are considered “snub-nosed” breeds and therefore are not even permitted on the flight due to their breathing difficulties and inability to cool themselves down. This dog was so clearly a French bulldog that there was no way that it could have been argued otherwise. It made me more upset knowing that if only the protocol had been enforced, this could potentially have been avoided altogether. 

First and foremost, the responsibility for this dog’s negligent death lies at the hands of the owners. They should have known better, end of the story. However, the “second check” that happens by flight staff also failed. I am tormented by the thought that this could be occurring all over the world on board these flights.

"Desktop","2","review","0",,"On October 17th 2021, I was returning home to Seattle from San Jose on Delta flight DL3768 at 7:30pm.  After we boarded the plane and sat in the cabin for a few minutes, the pilot informed us of a 15-20 minute take-off delay.  Not a big deal.  There was a thunderstorm in Tacoma, and SEATAC had slowed the number of landings they would accept.  This seemed fine to me and completely reasonable.

About 20 minutes later, the pilot let us know the wait was now 45 minutes.  Real nice, but also not Delta’s fault.  Around 8:30, she came back on the intercom one last time to tell us the delay was now two hours.  It was then she announced we were going to unload the plane and they would let us mill about the airport until it was time to leave.

A handful of us had a sorely needed margarita at the Mexican bar that was right next to our gate, but the kitchen was closed.  Having had no dinner, I wandered farther down the terminal in search of protein.  This was around 9:05.

After a small and mediocre sandwich, I came back to the gate to find it completely empty - no passengers, no staff, and even the monitors were dark.  It was around 9:30 now, and I’d only been out of earshot for about 25 minutes before returning to this Twilight Zone episode.

I couldn’t find my flight on any of the arrival or departure screens, and there were no Delta employees in sight.  In fact, the entire airport seemed suddenly abandoned.  At 10pm, I finally found someone who worked at Delta who was manning a gate where a flight had just arrived.  After a brief verbal exchange that sounded like a “Who’s On First” routine about where I had come from and what I was asking about, she was finally able to pull up the information on my missing airplane.

They took off without me.  My flight had left a half an hour ago.  There was no airport-wide announcement that the flight was boarding (and I was listening to a paranoid degree).  They didn’t call my name or look for missing passengers, and they left an entire hour before they said they were going to.

This part was Delta’s fault.  More than that, it felt almost personal.  I know how long it takes to board a plane, and the answer is not 25 minutes.  I’m trying to imagine the mad scramble it must have taken to get the plane fully boarded and off the ground while my back was turned, like an episode of Punk’d or Jackass.  I must have just missed them when I returned to the gate.  Just to twist the knife a little harder, they took my luggage – the roller bag they forced me to check because they overbooked the flight – to Seattle without me.

I assumed the woman that was helping me would put me on the next flight out, and she did – for 7am.  Say what now?  How can there not be any flights for the next 9 hours?  I wasn’t offered any accommodations or reimbursements despite the fact that it was Delta’s fault I was stranded.  

After doing the math, I realized I would only get four or five hours of sleep if I left the airport and came back, so I stayed there.  After 11, the terminal became an absolute ghost town.  Even the shops shut down.  I stayed there all night with the fluorescent lights, the stupid saxophone music on loop, no humans, no food, no sleep, and no water (since I wasn’t about the try the public fountain during a pandemic).

When I finally arrived at Seattle-Tacoma, I almost left without my bag.  The person who was helping me couldn’t find it anywhere, despite the fact that it was a very distinct lime green.  She checked and double-checked before finally opening a ticket and saying they would get back to me.  I figured they had just completely lost it as the one final insult of this trip, and moped out of the office.

Incidentally, I found it myself.  I spotted the green hard-shell in the one and only one luggage cage she hadn’t checked.  Apparently no one is supposed to use that crate because the lock is broken.  Lovely.

I was one of the last people checking into the flight (due to trying to get through some work before departure after back to back meetings) and they said that I need to check the bag. I politely asked if they can have another look if they can accommodate it in the cabin as I am flying every few days for business and waiting for a bag is really inconvenient. They said that I should check with  the cabin crew. I did the same and gentleman on this flight (DL3643 departing at 17:44 SFO to LAX-the only male within the cabin crew),  like a robot responded that I need to check it. I said please, could you have a look as I have been jet lagged for weeks traveling for business and this is really inconvenient. He said that this is a small national flight and didn’t bother even looking, didn’t care to hear more from me. So I checked my bag and honestly you could fit at least 5 carry-ons on this flight. I understand that there are rules but this is just zero carrying and customer service. I am traveling for 2 months for work with a carry on and a back back just so I don’t have to check a bag and spend time on waiting for it.

Literally a sickening experience doing business with Delta. These unscrupulous, INCOMPETENT degenerates will ""inconvenience"" you til you're traumatized to squeeze the profits and are so enthusiastic about denying culpability for their INCOMPETENCE that it never dawn's on them to seek a solution! 

On their overbooked flight, they insisted on checking my carry on despite my protests, then bumped us because they were at weight capacity. They claimed my companion was late, then allowed me 5 minutes to let me off when it would have taken 30 seconds to let him on. 
One of their Toadies let it slip that they were at weight capacity, ironically, while he was making excuses for not helping me.

Our plans after that depended completely on where and how we could get our stuff back. We were informed it would be waiting for us in New Orleans. There were normal flights to New Orleans but we did manage to arrive the next day, filthy and exhausted. 

These people have every means of getting in touch with their passengers. EVERY MEANS! Nobody did.
Nobody apologized. Nobody accepted accountability. Nobody managed to simply send me my bag! Nobody even called me back, gave me a case number, or otherwise followed their own protocol.

FOUR DAYS I struggled on hold, getting disconnected, getting treated like trash, to get my luggage (which had my MEDICATION) before flying home just for that purpose only to find 5 lazy toads sitting around looking bored and annoyed to lift their heavy derriere of their chairs and retrieve my bag. 

Thousands of dollars to be tortured in a different state with nothing but the airport polluted clothes on my back, on hold with clueless, apathetic luggage department. Shame on you Delta. I'm amazed you manage not to crash.","Worst experience I've ever spent $1000s on","false","false"

However, no effort was made to get passengers seated quickly. Then the pilot said we had to redistribute the load so that took some time. No effort was made to speed up the flight. When we got to Detroit the ground handlers were slow to come out and that meant we missed the connection. We found out that there were at least four connections missed by passengers on that flight. Delta did give us a hotel room in Detroit but all we had was the stuff in my backpack. Our new flight moved us from Comfort +  to Coach and crummy coach seats at that. We upgraded to first class to avoid those seats at a cost of $650. On the way home Delta lost my wife's suitcase.

The flight was overbooked and we were herded in like cattle. No social distancing, no mask enforcement. There was a very sick child on the plane--old enough to wear a mask but the parents did not keep a mask on the child while he coughed up a lung on all of us. We spoke to the flight attendant who refused to enforce the policy. 

Then the food service came though and we requested a single serving water bottle to keep the cough germs from falling into our cups --but the flight attendant refused - claiming that she did not have any bottles of water.  This was a lie because we saw them being used in first class just a few rows up. 

Lastly this same lying flight attendant would not let anyone stow their bags above their seats. As people boarded she insisted they take the first available bin. What?! This resulted in all the bins at the front of the plane being full as people entered--so the rest of the passengers had to then go to the back of the plane to store them and then go against the current to get back to their seats. People got stuck in the back storing their bags and couldn't get back to their seats. I have never seen such a chaotic boarding situation!

This time the legroom was great but I was not happy when the customer in front reclined. The service for this leg was also good but not quite up to the standard of the first.

"Desktop","5","review","1",,"My Wife and I just completed a “Bucket List” 49th Anniversary Viking River Cruise Trip that was exceptional! 
 
We were originally scheduled to fly British Airways to Budapest however that was changed to an American flight and then finally to a Delta flight. I was happy in that a number of Friends have told me how nice Delta is v. American. I have not flown Delta in a number of years opting for American because we were primarily flying out of AA Hubs in Philadelphia and Orlando. 

Boy were they right!  From Baggage Check in to Friendliness to Cleanliness and Flight Attendant Attitude, Delta wins hands down. 
 
We were flying First Class so there was access to the Delta Club in both Orlando and Atlanta as well as the KLM Club in Amsterdam.  They were clean / airy, the Reception was extremely friendly, the choices of food and beverages was very good, windows clean and seating comfortable. 

Check In was a breeze and the cubical seating was clean and comfortable with lots of at seat storage space.  The seats were highly adjustable.  We were on an Airbus 380 series.  

There was a mechanical issue with our flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam which caused a 1 ½ hour delay in departure.  Someone had flushed a toy on the previous flight that was stuck in a critical valve for offloading the toilet waste.  This was discovered after everyone was on board and the decision made to remain boarded rather than deplane.  The captain kept everyone informed of their progress in the remediation with factual information sprinkled with a little humor.  

The flight attendants made everyone on the plane as comfortable as possible. 

When underway, the cabin service was great, the food upscale restaurant quality and the entertainment selections were current.  I cannot sleep on planes so I was able to notice the flight attendants were checking on everyone every 15 minutes.  They also attended to the toilets every 30 minutes.  The wake – up process was “gentle” and well executed.  The entertainment headsets were left at our seats on deplaning. 

The delay meant we had missed our connection in Amsterdam however, after passing through the Immigration Check, when we arrived at the KLM Club, they had our tickets waiting (same seats same class) for us on the next flight to Budapest departing in 1 ½ hours.  Turned out to be a FUN flight as one of the flight attendants was on her last flight with KLM and moving on to a new career.  Everyone was celebrating her the entire flight. 

Older model 737 but clean and comfortable.  Offboarding and baggage claim were easy in Budapest.

Flipside:

Our return flight was on an American 780 series aircraft.  We were first in line to check in on an early morning flight with all documentation ready.  

The person at the check in counter had obviously had a rough night and was not a happy individual.  

That attitude continued when our boarding passes were printed and had split up my Wife and I on a 10+ hour flight from Amsterdam to Dallas.  The reasoning given was the captain had rights to one of our seats.  I’ve flown numerous international business / first  flights and never had that happen.  

The check in person was borderline rude stating that was the policy and we could change to the last row (next to a galley and restroom) or stay in the current separated seats.  We went for the last row so we could be together.  It turned out to be a good move in that the noise up front from meal preparation and utensils was very loud.  By the way, the captain never availed himself / herself to that seat the entire flight.  

There was no priority loading and it was a free for all line up to board the plane.  No attention to Group Number at all. 
 
The plane obviously had not been cleaned thoroughly from the previous flight and the overhead bins were dirty on the outside as well.  My seat had popcorn and other detritus from the previous flight in the side of the cushion. 

The food was the worst I have encountered on an International flight (that's 40 years).  My steak was dried out and very tough .. could not eat it.  My wife’s was the same.  For the flight attendants, it was as if it was a chore to provide service to passengers.  The attendants checked up on passengers at one-hour intervals with a walk by (but no attention to empty drinks or trash) unless someone used the call button.  

The toilets were not serviced the entire flight.  

180 degrees from Delta.  

The Wake-Up process consisted of turning the cabin lights on full.  The flight attendants retrieved the entertainment headsets 30 minutes prior to landing.  It was as if the passengers were going to steal them ..  not a good vibe.  On most domestic flights, the headsets are retrieved no more than 10 minutes prior to landing.

Back on US soil, the Admiral’s Club in Dallas was very good.  Reception was friendly, seating areas clean, typical selection of food and the seats comfortable.  Our 737 to Orlando was clean and the flight attendant was very good. 
 
American has always been a step below others on International Carriers but acceptable when garnering points.  

With our experience on this International Flight, we will begin exploring Delta on Domestic Flights and opt for Delta over American on any International Flights from now on

He offered to help me download the Delta app for $20. I said no, I can give him $10. He became upset and said he doesn't want to waste his ""f'n time"" helping me for $10. I retrieved my passport and said I no longer want his help. He tried to grab my passport out of my hand when I refused to work with him and requested to work with someone else. When I asked for his name, he flipped his name tag and refused to give me his name. Eventually, I found another Delta worker (I think it was his supervisor) who helped me get my boarding pass. This is unacceptable and unethical for workers to request additional funds to help passengers get on their flight. And for workers to be able to hide their name tags at their leisure. I did not know that Delta treats the elderly this way.

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"I've flown delta for years under the impression that they're a little nicer than other airlines but as of late that's just not true. Recently my family and I were flying to Bozeman MT to visit Yellowstone National Park. When I tried to book my tickets online there was some sort of issue with the website so I had to call delta, when I spoke to a delta representative they were able to book the flight but they put my wife and I on one reservation and my kids on a separate reservation. I was assured that this was essentially just a technicality and something that needed to happen to accommodate whatever issue was happening on Delta's side, but that it would not negatively impact my travel. 

The first issue came up when we tried to check in. We couldn't check my kids in online as they were 'unaccompanied minors'. They're not flying unaccompanied, but to Delta it looked that way, so I called Delta again, they said there was nothing I could do, but we would just have to check in at any of the counters at the airport. After arriving 2 hours early as instructed we found a delta employee, explained that we needed to check bags and check in unaccompanied minors. They directed us to a service counter where we waited about 30 minutes in line. Once it was our turn the person at this counter informed us that there's a special counter for unaccompanied minors and that we'd have to wait in another line. An hour and fifteen minutes later we finally had our boarding passes and made our way to security. We arrived 2 hours prior to departure and made it to our gate 15 minutes after our flight's scheduled departure time, the only reason we made the flight is that it was running an hour late. 

We had also paid extra to choose our own seats, since we were traveling with our kids we wanted to make sure we're all sitting together. On our return flight however they seemed to misplace our seat assignments and put us elsewhere not together, not the seats we had chosen and paid for. 

I've had good experiences with delta in the past, but this was not one. It also wasn't limited to one person or one airport or one counter, every step of the way we got bad information or had to wait longer than was acceptable or didn't get services we paid for. I'm not sure I'd write delta off completely as I think this probably just puts them on par with other airlines.

The flight attendants were nice, but perhaps too nice -- they wouldn't and didn't have passengers raise their seatbacks before landing (or after), so we had to struggle to get out.

Actually the garden was pretty nice and the burger quite tasty. At the gate, there was an incredibly boring gate agent talking all kinds of nonsense. Like he was saying something about a recent trip he took and how different the scanner is they have here from where he went. Nobody cares. I just wanted to get on board for some reason. He tried to come off real folksy and friendly like. I'm not sure why he's so annoying. Maybe it's because when I got on the plane , I saw all these people passing me by and how close I was to them...  I put on a  second mask. This pandemic got me so anxious all the time.  I mean you can follow my thinking, right?  Anywayon the plane, i began to wonder what all the other people were thinking when I started spraying down my pillow and blanket with the mini Lysol Grace gave me. Looked like most people on board didn't care. I'll tell you what - flight attendants were real friendly and nice. I'm a bit surprised because I thought they were all up-tight and grumpy because of the recent hassles they get from passengers because of the mask mandates. Rolling out to that runway I always see when I'm at Hickam Beach was kind of cool so I videoed it.  And so the flight starts. Not too impressed with this first class seat I had. I didn't see any kind of hand control for the entertainment screen. It's all touchscreen.  Don't worry, I cleaned it with Chlorox wipes first. It's kind of far from the seat so it was hard to see especially for a blind old man like me. The seat itself was comfortable enough I guess since it lays out flat. I had a couple Bloody Marys made with Finlandia Vodka.  They didn't have any lemon to put in it so that was disappointing. It was a box meal for lunch. Actually a tasty spring chicken salad with strawberries and spinach and walnuts. Certainly not a first-class meal but you know the pandemic gives them a reason to go quick and cheap.

   Horrible horrible horrible you’re traveling internationally do not take Delta they use air France the worst aircraft I’ve ever been on they use recycled air so it’s very hot and stuffy the whole plane ride. Then the next aircraft remove me from the flight because the three flight attendants were rude disrespectful discriminate horrible tone voice. 

   Then the next aircraft taken believe me I prefer cold and the aircraft was beyond freezing it was having icicles that were falling from the windowsill inside the aircraft even the guy next to me says I’ve never been on an aircraft it’s this cold it was freezing as if you were in Alaska during coldest month of year. 

    Then when I get back into America Air France left in my suitcase in Paris. They are so on organized and careless that I didn’t even have my big suitcase with all the Necessities for over two days after my arrival.

    To make matters worse then recovering from a Reconstructive major nose surgery in turkey, beskitas two days later I’m having to drive by car back to international airport in Georgia to pick up my suitcase that never arrived when it should have when I arrived! 

   Then following the trip I’m calling customer service to tell them it’s horrible experience and they just keep giving you all different number so if you just don’t end up speaking to somebody at the end of the day!

    Mark my words, I will never ever fly Delta international again being that they partnership with Air France! Delta get with it figure out a better connection to have said an unorganized not efficiently run Air France

   I shouldn’t of had to pay $1250 for a round-trip plane ticket you guys should’ve been paying me for such a horrible experience. And I requested a full refund being that this was an awful awful time experience coming back and yet I was not responded back to

    Feel free to check attachment that was my plane ticket to show that what I’m saying from connecting flight Turkey to connecting flight to Paris to Atlanta was nightmare along with a delayed suitcase etc. etc.

     When I made all those phone calls to Delta being ignored about having a refund you guys would’ve save a lot more money having me the refund and Refraining from writing this poor review well deserved for people to make sure they don’t take an international flight with Delta/air France good job!!!

"Desktop","1","review","0",,"This trip was a birthday trip for my 11 year old daughter, the flights to San Diego were okay with the exception of the seating I paid extra to have assigned being changed on us. The return flight to Tampa was a complete nightmare: about 20 minutes AFTER we were supposed to begin boarding they made an announcement that the flight would be delayed until THE NEXT MORNING. Turning a 9pm Saturday flight into a 9am Sunday flight. They couldn't provide hotels, rental cars, food vouchers, nothing to make up for the rebooked flight. Us and about 90% of the oarders slept in the airport. My 11 year old daughter, my boyfriend, and myself, had to sleep in the airport lobby. Throughout the night we got notifications that this flight was being delayed EVEN FURTHER. The next morning we did not board until nearly 1130 which made our arrival time back home about 10 or 11pm, an entire 24 hours lost because delta had no backups for this flight. Not only were we not boarded until another two hours later than initially promised for a flight that was already delayed for 12 hours, once again my paid seating was no longer assigned to me or my daughter, they had moved her seating to an exit window rows away from me. We kept our originally seating and they had to reseat the boarders they sold MY PAID SEATS to. The final straw was my boyfriends luggage not arriving with us back in Tampa. Despite us checking all our luggage in at the same time his somehow didn't make it into the flight we were on and wasn't going to arrive until midnight, about 2 hours after we landed. We just chose to get it shipped to us. 

After all this delta refused any kind of refund, no refund on the seating fee I paid that was not honored, no partial refund for a flight that was essentially rebooked, nothing but flight credit for a company I'm never going to use again. The excuse is that we still got from point A to point B but when you book a flight you're not JUST paying for passage, you're paying for a seat you selected, your luggage to be where you are, the time you selected to fly and arrive, not to lose an entire day, sleep in an airport, and basically have no other choices. If we could have not taken the flight we would have.

Tl;dr: delta will make your travel plans useless, rebook you and and call it a delay, then tell you you don't deserve your money back because they still got you home a day late after sleeping in an airport without 1/3 of the luggage you left with.","Horrible experience, worse customer service.","false","false"

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"Well just completed my first post pandemic international trip to Paris (and a few other European locales).  By way of background, I have been on many First/Business class intercontinental flights on almost all the larger carriers.

We were excited to try Delta’s relatively new “suite” product aboard the Airbus 330.  At first glance, it looks like a great product.  The configuration is 1-2-1 so all seats have an aisle access.  Unfortunately, the seat was not so comfortable (a bit stiff with no real ergonomic support), the arm rests are set too high and become uncomfortable. On my flight the door to the suite was broken and the touchscreen (on the, nice large TV) was inoperative.  

Where Delta has really given up the ghost is on food service.  I’ve flown them recently from SLC-TPA, CDG-JFK and JFK-SLC, all in Business and I’ve yet to get a nice meal.  On this flight — a premium city pair Paris to New York, they supplied no physical menu.  Wine offerings were white or red (not multiple of each which is typical).  On the other flights to Tampa and SLC (these were 5 hour dinner flights), I’ve been given a box with either snacks or a really dreadful sandwich.  

Most people are not enthralled about wearing a mask for hours and hours on end and I’ve told Delta that skimping on food an beverage aboard is not the way to get the higher end customers back.  By contrast, I flew AirFrance from JFK to CDG (as a codeshare) and the seat, food and beverage was far superior (a menu, multiple entree and wine choices,  working seats and monitors, etc.)

Just something to keep in mind before you plunk down your money for a European trip and get disappointing food beverage and seating!","Post pandemic travel blues on Delta","false","false"

I'm a petite woman so it's not like I take up a lot of room and even I had trouble walking down the aisle without bumping seats and the people in them. The seats are insanely uncomfortable and I can't image how terrible they must be for the average person. Leg room is virtually nonexistent, and this coming from someone who is 5ft tall.  The cabins are hot. I understand you can't make everyone happy, but when you're sweating just by sitting there, something is wrong. You can always add a layer or blanket but I can't sit there naked. Please just turn on the air.

It's quit funny how they want you to wear a mask, having a covid test, etc. but have no problem packing passengers in like canned sardines.

Complimentary snacks? Not hardly. First, let's just say that a small up of water and a tiny pack of almonds are the least they could do considering the astronomical prices they charge. Also $30 for a checked bag? Do you expect people to travel with no luggage? They also do not have enough overhead bins for each passenger to have a carry-on. 

Another issue I've already encountered is that they will not uphold their own wording on their website. I don't have the time nor patience to go into that matter on here but just know, what you read on the Delta site may or may NOT be honored.

I did have a comfortable seat, and a bottle of water and some earphones were provided at the start of the flight.  However it would have cost about $10 to get wi-fi access, a service that is available for free in economy on some other airlines.

The flight attendant was pleasant, but the service was nothing special.  First class customers weren't even offered the little package of cookies they give out in coach on Delta.  Instead our ""meal"" was one of the snack boxes they have available for purchase to economy customers.  On a 5 1/2 hour flight this wasn't much of a meal.    I'd have far preferred the sandwiches that are also available for purchase, but only the snack box was provided in first class.

Theoretically unlimited drinks were available, but the flight attendant came by exactly once with a drink service.  She didn't even give me the can from my Diet Coke.  Instead I got a tiny cup (the size of a bathroom water cup) that was mostly filled with ice.   Apparently alcoholic beverages were also available, but we were given no indication of that.  So a teeny cup of Diet Coke and that initial bottle of water were the beverages I was given on a flight from the Caribbean to the upper Midwest.

I don't normally do reviews but people need to know what kind of shady operation they are dealing with.  

Our vacation was booked through Delta Vacations.  They didn't leave enough time to transfer at JFK so we missed our connection.  Spent 7 hours locked in the terminal till Delta got us a motel so we could get a flight the next day.  Then had to spend 2 hours in the summer heat getting retested for COVID.  Called DV and they called resort to let them know we'd be late and asked to shift our stay so we got our 7 days at the resort.  They said they would let us know.  Day 2 we got to the resort.  Day 3 nothing from DV so I called (international call, long wait, sitting in room instead of beach for 2 hours) and DV said nothing from resort.  Because I called, they said they would send another email and let us know by email.  Day 5, Still nothing from DV even though they promised so once again I'm sitting in my room for 2 more hours.  No response from motel so because I called, they sent resort another email.  I asked if after 5 days they could possibly call the motel, ""NO"".  They said this was a priority and she would update me before she went home and follow up in the morning.  I asked for her name and she hung up.   Nothing from DV.  Day 6, I made one last attempt and got Taye, a DV supervisor.  No, they hadn't heard anything from the motel, because I called, they would send the resort an email.  This was the highest priority for DV.  Can you call resort ""NO"", I will call or email you.  She didn't.  I called to confirm our transport to the airport and the DV rep listened to my story and said that all they had to do was call her and she would've had it fixed in no time.  DV Customer support just didn't want to help me so they did the very minimum and then only when I pushed them.  I messaged/posted (deleted) them on FB that this was the worst vacation of my life and I wanted a full refund.  DV was sorry and wanted to talk to me.  

Kathryn, one of their sugary sweet young lady called and apologized 100 times but said the only compensation she was authorized to extend was the refund for the day I lost and $400 in travel vouchers.  I said that was insulting for completely ruining our vacation.  I asked her if there was any record of them trying to call me.  She didn't see anywhere.  Did they try to email me She didn't see that anywhere.  I asked her that after 6 days and untold emails if she thought that they could've tried to call someone.  She said it wasn't their policy.   I asked her if she thought that this was good customer service.  No comment.  I will go back to my supervisor and see if there is anything else I can do.  I said if her supervisor was worth anything they would call me back.  

A few hours later the sweet voice calls back and apologizes 10 more times and said she got them to go up another $200 to $600 in travel vouchers with DV.

When we walked up together hand in hand asking for the seat tickets the lady gave it to us and we got aboard the plane. When I checked our seats, my daughter’s seat and mine were not together (actually my seat was half way across the other side of the plane). As you can understand I don’t want my daughter sitting next to a stranger through a 8-12 hour flight especially since she’s young (7 years old). So we ask a member of staff about the issue and they said to ask the person who has that seat to swap with you. Understandable. So when the man arrives I ask him if he can swap his seat with mine so we can sit together, he therefore agrees and everything is fine. Or so I thought. 

About 10-20 minutes later the man starts to complain and wants his seat back and sit next to my daughter despite the fact we agreed on swapping. A member of staff approaches and asks what’s wrong and the man says even though we agreed to swap seats he’s upset about it. The lady who gave us the seat tickets came on board and asked me to go to my original seat so he can have his original seat back. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that since I don’t want my daughter sitting next to a stranger for 12 hours and that we already agreed. So then I asked her why she gave us different seats in the first place and she said and I quote “You both came up to me separately so I thought you were separate passengers” MY DAUGHTER IS 7 AND WE WERE TOGETHER HOLDING HANDS WHILST WE GOT OUR SEAT TICKETS!! SHE LIED! So I called her out on her lie explaining how we were there together and she wasn’t happy with that so she threatened me and my daughter that we will get kicked off the plane if we don’t co operate! 

The man decides that it’s okay and he’ll sit in my original seat like we agreed on however throughout the rest of the flight, the staff were giving me the silent treatment and were giving me glares, side eyes and judgemental looks despite the fact I acted in a calm manner throughout the situation unlike the seat ticket lady who got sassy and disrespectful.

The flight attednats where terrific. the Captain on Delta flight 2229 was the best. He even told the cabin ""please be nice to the flight attednats they did make up the mask mandate so please do not be rude to them"" he then asked for military and vets to raise their hand to thank us.

Negative (sorry but this makes no sense. There is no reason 2 Alliance partners can not check bags with each other)

My girlfriend and i flew from Dallas to Tenerife with no layovers. DAL to MIA on Delta and MIA to TFN on Air Europa. Delta agents a DAL said that even though Air Europa is Skyteam they could not check bags on them. So when we get to Miami 1 of our bags showed up and they other did not so a 5 hr connection turned into almost missing our plane becuase Delta can not transfer bags i guess. Air Europa on the other hand my bags both showed together at the same time as i did. Maybe Delta needs to move to the kids table and Air Europa to the adults table.

I would not recommend Delta after this.  The reasons are:  with no thru checking of bags on other carriers then you can save 300 bucks from the start on Southwest. I had to use main cabin in Delta to pick my seat. Which was about 2-300 more than Southwest wanna get away fares even adding the early bird on southwest you still save money and get 2 checked bags free which saves you another 40 bucks or more per bag. AND you still have to go claim your bags and go back thru security, just like we had to with Delta/Air Europa.

I had very high expectations of Delta even got the Amex Delta Platinum card but after this i will be canceling the delta card and my skymiles account as i can not see a reason to fly Delta again.  Since i harldy ever leave the US and unless Southwest goes out of business i can not justify a financial reason to fly Delta again.","Very good but much better options out there.","false","false"

Our flight was scheduled at 8:05 AM in morning to Minneapolis and arrived at airport at 6:30 AM. Since it was an infant seat boarding pass was not getting printed and we had to checkin bags and car seat.

The queue at checkin gate was so long and even after requesting multiple times the lady in front of delta checkin gate did not care to accommodate us in anyway. It took for ever as we were probably 100th person waiting to check in. With the rate things were moving we again requested her and see if she could help us NO. Eventually we checked in but it was already 7:35 and with toddler we still rushed to get security. There was a backlog even there and finally we went to gate at 7:55 am and they had closed the gate. So we missed the flight. We thought we will wait and see next available options.

We got a connecting flight to SLC and then to Bozeman. But SLC flight was already delayed and we had to wait for 12 hours in Boston airport and finally boarded at 6 PM.  We would reach Bozeman at 12:05 AM. So we know car rental is closed and we need an accommodation. The Delta person who made changes to lay over and connecting flight told they took care of accommodation for overnight in Bozeman and to collect which hotel info directly in Bozeman and we trusted blindly.

We finally reached SLC and we wanted to confirm hotel in Bozeman but the queue was so long again we did not get to talk to delta representative as we were running late to next flight.

We landed in Bozeman and the ground Delta representative in Bozeman told there was no communication for them to book hotels for us and weekend are pretty busy in summer and she flat out told everything will be booked. Then at 12:30 AM we called atleast 25 hotels to see if there was any availability but None and it was too late to book. There is no car rental no hotel and with a baby. Finally at 1:30 AM we decided we will sleep in Bozeman airport since it was a long day. And finally delta representative provided some bed sheet since we had a baby.

I am not going to chose Delta because they cannot book a full flight to make money and not have staff to help us. They just are overbooked and probably current staff is overworked and they just do not care about customer.","Do not travel with Delta","false","false"

At this time they were also unloading peoples luggage—luggage that was heavy. They didn’t inform us that they were doing this until many of us arrived in Paris and were not able to pick-up our bags. They arrived 20 minutes later than they informed us . My understanding is that the delay had more to do with an overbooked flight and heavy luggage rather than cleaning. They should have informed the twelve people whose luggage they were unloading from the plane.  I have mo clothes to wear and a bag full of baby items that are waiting to be delivered to me.

Our first flight from our destination origin to Atlanta landed AFTER the Atlanta to Costa Rica flight began boarding.

We couldn’t get to our connecting flight because Delta booked our first flight that was set to land at 9:20. Our second flight’s boarding started at 8:50. THIRTY MINUTES before the first plane was scheduled to land. Take-off was 9:45. 

We asked our flight attendants THREE times if we could deplane early to make it to our connecting flight and they said “No”. Even though, we were promised by multiple Delta agents that the flight attendants would allow us to deplane ahead of the rest of the guests. 

My travel partner has disability. The Delta flight attendants did not accommodate this.  

I then had to fight with the gate agents to allow us on the connecting flight. 

Then, the cherry on top is delta losing our luggage. 

We have absolutely no clothes nor do we have my traveling partner’s medications. 

Oh, and to make it even better?

The Delta flight attendants are not enforcing masks on the plane, when it’s a federal mandate. If you want to travel Delta, be prepared to get Covid. The Delta flight attendants won’t enforce the mask mandates and there were many guests walking up & down the aisle of the plane without their mask on. 

After seeing the way Delta handled COVID at the height of the pandemic, I swore I’d only fly Delta from here on out. 

However, this experience has entirely ruined our trip. 

We are left without my travel partner’s medication. 

Delta customer service is horrid. They will not respond and I have been on 3-hour holds multiple times.

We had no choice at that time to purchase it then figured we’d call customer service to see what happened. Getting someone on the phone is daunting. I called at 9 am and was told to leave a callback # and get a call back in 2 hrs. Well, 5 hrs later I got my call. They told me that once she booked her seat for the cheaper price, the system immediately raised the price of the other seat. He said it was supply and demand and that since I bought the seat there was nothing he could do. He said I shouldn’t have bought the seat and call Delta, which is crazy because you can’t get anyone to answer. He made me feel as if I should have known the price jump would happen and it was my fault. All I wanted was to pay the same price as my wife. Extenuating circumstances put us on 2 different reservations this time, if they gave me a credit for the difference I would’ve been happy. They will not work with you.

During final check, I was told that me, my wife and my four kids had to vacate the flight. After leaving the plane, I was told that I should have researched the requirements although four separate Delta employees stated that I was good to fly. A Delta employee, Elizabeth, giving hotel vouchers was rude and walked away without answering questions about how to get to the hotel and if I would receive refunds on the two pet fees that I paid that morning.

I missed my connection in MSP and, because of that, was unable to get my rental car the next day (no cars available due to car shortage, they cancel your reservation if you don't pick up car within a certain number of hours).  Airline did not offer any food voucher in Seatac.  They did put out small tray of tiny bags of cookies or Cheez-its after over 6 hours.  The gate agent in Seatac was the only positive experience - Tomoko helped so many people rearrange their flight plans and even stayed beyond her shift to make sure everyone was taken care of.  We were reassured that hotels should be covered in MSP given late hour of arrival, missing connections, cause of delay was mechanical failure.  However, after waiting in 2 long lines in MSP late at night, we were told that no hotel rooms were available (which turned out to be BS because I spoke with another passenger while waiting for a hotel shuttle, who arrived after I did - she missed her connection and said Delta was putting her up in a hotel) and that arrangements and costs were on us.  All they offered was a $100 travel voucher, which was much less than the cost of any available hotel that I could find. 
On the flight itself, we only got one beverage service and were offered a tiny bag of almonds or the usual biscotti cookies.  You would think that after that long wait, they would give you at least a bag of chips/cookies and two beverage services, which other airlines do on that leg as a routine.

Not far enough for anything other than Silver Medallion status, but I generally buy first class tickets for the comfort and convenience.  My husband owns a business and flys long distances with the distance totals earning him Gold Medallion status, but the trip durations are months at a time, so he makes roughly 3-4 international trips annually.  We used to buy the Delta Club access for him, but I was unable to use it without traveling with him (I occasiinally visit him) so I opened an American Express account so that I could pay to use the club when I traveled alone.  That was wonderful until months after opening the account, they discontinued that benefit so I closed the account.  Now the Club only allows Delta One Members which is disappointing to say the least. I  still fly first class, but I've begun to notice the lack of little things.

We landed and came to find out (my party was seated in the back of the plane) that almost all of the passengers around me had 30ish minutes to make their connections too.  Now over the speakers we hear something to the tune of if you miss your connection, go to the help desk.  I balk at this.  It would be very simple to tell the passengers to stay seated and let the people who have tight connections off first, since this was your airline's fault and not the fault of the passengers.  This did not happen.  Seems to me that it would save everyone a lot of trouble... including the help desk who would have to deal with upset customers.  But hey, I guess I am wrong.  

We run once the crowd breaks and this would have been fine because the gate was only a few gates away.  We get there and the walkway is still extended but no one is at the desk.  I panic... don't forget... my mother is in the hospital... on a ventilator after her heart attacks.  I run over to the next desk and she is kind enough to call someone which was for nothing as I turn around I see the walkway retracting.  

What ensued was my husband trying to keep me from having a full on meltdown.  After I was calm he told me that a gate agent finally showed up and called him a liar that we were not there before the walkway retracted.  Great customer service, let me tell you.  

We hurriedly made our way to the help desk.  My husband has to end up dealing with it because I am so upset.  We were given a few options and finally settled on taking a midnight flight to Atlanta and then from Atlanta to my final destination at San Antonio.  There was no guarantee that my husband could even be on the last leg of the flight with my daughter and I.  We had to just hope.

Flight to Atlanta went off fine with little to no sleep.  I ended up resting a little at the airport but was utterly exhausted and still had a full day ahead of me.   My husband was on the standby as the first person and once I boarded with my daughter we just held our breath in hope that he would get on.  We were the last passengers on the plane that weren't ticketed.  After that another 6 or 7 people were boarded even though my husband was right at the gate and assured by the desk he would be first standby.  More great customer service.  I don't mind not being number one but I sure do mind being lied to.  Luckily, he was able to get on and we made it to San Antonio together, albeit with a very bad taste in our mouth from our experience.  

We arrived back home last night and I was waiting till I had time to write this and be able to articulate it without coming off as completely nasty.  Want to know the irony of this?  We flew Alaska home- a direct flight.  As we landed I was still listening to music and out of the corner of my eye I saw my family laughing.  I removed my earbud and asked what.  Can you guess?  There were 6 people on the back of the plane that had connecting flights in Seattle.... the crew asked that the whole plane stay seated to allow those passengers off first.  I just had to shake my head.  That's how it's done.  That's how you take care of your customers and keep them coming back.  As I deplaned I stopped at the front to thank the crew for doing that for them.  And this is why I will always fly Alaska whenever possible.  Top tier service and thoughtfulness for not only their passengers time but the well being of their employees not having to deal with upset customers who missed a flight due to their own company.  In the future when they are not available I will seek out all other options before Delta.

(Oh and none of the charging ports worked except one in my daughter’s seat on the three planes we were on… thank goodness for the battery saving power of plane mode and airport charging.)","You have a connecting flight?  Too bad","false","false"
"Desktop","4","review","1",,"My family and I just took a trip to Disney World in Florida. We flew out of LaGuardia in New York on Delta. I'm a Delta SkyMiles member, and have been for about 20 years. My wife and I have flown Delta many times with both ups and downs. I was particularly worried this time because of all of the problems the pandemic has wrought upon the airline industry. My uneasiness increased when about an 1 1/2 hours before our flight was scheduled to board I received a text that our flight was being delayed for about 2 1/2 hours. We were traveling with our daughter, her husband and three grandchildren and I had terrible visions of the flight being cancelled (ala Spirit, American etc) and trying to re-book seven tickets. About a 1/2 hour into the delay a Delta representative came to the gate and let everyone know that the fight was delayed because of problems with the plane and that they were flying in another plane  from Atlanta. Kuddos to Delta for letting us know the reason for the delay and what they were doing to get us to our destination. Passengers at a minimum want to be kept informed of what is going on with their flights and why their flights are delayed and/or cancelled. It was great to see that done in this instance. A few years ago, on a Delta  flight  from Orlando to New York our flight was was delayed multiple times for over 6 hours until it was ultimately cancelled at about 12:30 am. No one from Delta ever told us anything and we ended up sleeping in the airport while we waited for our re-booked flight. The main reason for this review is that we wanted to commend the entire flight crew and in particular one of their members; Shira (did not get her last name). I've been flying for over 40 years and never met such a pleasant and friendly flight attendant. Given all that is going on with the pandemic, delayed & cancelled flights, rude & aggressive passengers etc., it was truly a pleasure seeing someone who actually appeared to be happy at work. It was a pleasure meeting her and the rest of the flight crew. They all did a great job and we hope to see them all again on our next flight.","Recent Trip to Orlando, Florida","false","false"

Couple days later Delta changed flight removing entire day of trip.
I tried on multiple occasions to reach customer service (even 3 a.m. one Sunday morning) to reschedule and was advised of 6 hour hold times on phone. I never reached a rep on phone.
Emailed Delta regarding attempts to change flight. It took over 30 days for a response informing me nothing could be done until AFTER my trip dates.
I then tried canceling flight. Website would not allow cancellation and oops! so sorry you are out 17,000 earned SkyMiles.
Additionally, I purchased travel insurance through Delta partner Allianz and emailed them to see if my policy covered loss. I never received any response from Allianz!
I have continued attempting to resolve issue (CEO Ed Bastian recently emailed customers with news about new e-credits and refunds) but to date no one at Delta has responded.

"Desktop","1","review","3",,"Bad experience in first class. I am pretty good about wearing a mask at all times but I think this particular flight attendant took it a little too far with me. We were given waters to drink and I took a drink and was talking to my wife and Johanna came by and reminded me to put my mask back on in between sips. A little strict and nonsensical for my blood, but fair enough. About an hour later I was eating my pretzels and just trying to relax and I just noticed Johanna was walking down the aisle again so I quickly pulled my mask back on to show her I was trying to abide by the rules. She rather abruptly and rudely came up to me and said that this was the third time (not true) that she has had to tell me to put my mask back on and that if she saw me with it down again we would be put on a list, barring me from flying with Delta again... I get they need to enforce these rules but I was not being out of line at all and was trying to go out of my way to follow these rules. Nevertheless I just shut my eyes the rest of the flight and tried not to interact with her again. Not a good experience especially for how expensive those tickets were. Let's all just try to be nice to each other again and have some common sense. That is all. Love, Casey","Johanna is a Nazi","false","false"

We purchased First class tickets because it was a long flight and I thought it would be fun for my teenaged daughters to sit in First Class for the first time.  I was wrong.  The Delta Website says they have hot food service on long flights in first class so I told my family not to eat before we boarded, it was a morning flight at 9:00am.  We got on board and were seated directly to a baby who was already screaming when we sat down.  There was no food service just a ""snack box"" that you can purchase in coach for $7.  The ""premium"" snacks were tiny bags of goldfish crackers and pretzels.  The lap baby next to us screamed for 4 straight hours with her parents unable to console her and the father who was seated two rows in front of the mother, toddler, and their 6 year old constantly coming back and bending over in the isle with his rear end in our faces during the entire trip.  Couldn't rest with the screaming, received no food service, were told there were no pillows or blankets.  Not worth the additional $600+ dollars per ticket we spent.  Called Delta to complain and was given  the most rude CS rep I have ever encountered and told basically ""too bad theres nothing we can do"".

"Desktop","2","review","1",,"I had a great deal of difficulty changing flights online. I don't think the process is intuitive. When you choose another flight, a price is listed, but a passenger typically would think this was an additional cost. Nowhere (that I could find) is the amount of credit from the original ticket shown. (This did eventually come up, but not until I'd taken a chance and clicked on a fare). Also, I couldn't find a way to exit without choosing seats...and therein lies the rub.

There were two passengers on the itinerary. I captured the one available seat ""at no extra charge,"" but then the only remaining seats had a $30 up-charge. Since I recently spent 2-1/2 hours on hold with Delta (and never got through), I paid up. Then, we arrived at the airport. The seat reservations had been canceled and we were reassigned seats. The good news--they were together. The bad news--neither seat was a Comfort Plus, for which I'd paid $30 extra. I asked the gate agent and he said they were both Comfort Plus. (He lied). As soon as we boarded, it was obvious they were not premium seats. I asked the flight attendant and she confirmed they weren't Comfort Plus. She said she would check with the gate agent...and that's the last we saw of her for the entire trip. I don't really blame her, because every seat on the flight was filled. However, changing the flight and then reassigning seats were both done by computer, and Delta could easily fix both.

I'm aware that I can ask Delta to refund the $30, but with all of the issues I experienced, I'm not going to bother. They will only issue e-refunds (with an expiration date) and I have no plans to go anywhere that Delta flies. I wouldn't even have flown Delta this time (because of their woke policies) if I'd had any other reasonable choice...but that's a whole 'nother story. I'm not saying I'll never fly Delta again, but given a choice...I won't.","Changing flights not intuitive, and then I didn't get the seat I paid for!","false","false"

Maybe dont sell me the tickets that you dont have the space for????? Anyway, i decided to help them out and checked 2 of my bags that would have been carry-ons(free of charge). 180 people boarding takes time. 5 planes on the tarmac takes time. 180 people deplaning takes time. I dont work for the airlines, but dont they know their own schedules??? As we were landing, a flight attendant called out connecting flights to inform the passengers of their ""time crunch"". The first 3 or 4 connecting cities left in less that 10 minutes. The door wasnt even open yet. Another 5 down the list i finally hear mine called out along with the gate ""you have 27 minutes"". 10 minutes later we finally were able to step off of the plane. Boarding ends 15min before departure...Regardless, we sprinted through 2 terminals to arrive, covered in sweat, at the gate we were given(was not on departure screen for some reason...?) Just to find out the attendant gave us the wrong gate, and our plane had already left.(explains the screen) our bags were on that plane. I went to customer service, who was not at all thrilled to help me. They told me to call the 24/7 service number. Like arent they there to help me in person???? The soonest flight they could put me on was 6 hours later. I went over to southwest to ask for seat but with delta refusing any non-voucher reimbursement, i was stuck with the 11 pm departure as opposed to my original 530pm arrival time. With nothing but the clothes on my back. Every customer service member i spoke to gave me another number to call, and the last one had me on hold for over an hour, luckily i had the time. Overall just absolutely terrible time management, employess working the gate have zero sense of urgency, but the attendants and pilots seemed genuinely apologetic about the situation even though it was out of their control.

The only complaint I have is you need to hire more people to answer the phone when someone has a problem and they need to call to talk to a human in order to get their problem fixed. No one is going to stay on hold for 6 hours+. Please do something about that!!

I read all the reviews on here. Most of them are bad reviews. A few are good. I believe most people have good experiences with Delta. A lot of people don't even think about writing a review unless something goes wrong and things don't go their way. I believe that's the reason why there are only a few good reviews and a ton of bad reviews. And it's the same way with most of other Airlines as well, if you take a look at their reviews. So I thought I'd share my positive review. A lot of people say don't fly with Delta, fly with United or American, Southwest or Spirit. You go on their review sites and people are saying the same thing ""Don't fly with Southwest or United, fly with Delta!!!"" It gets very confusing sometimes. But Delta, you are #1!!

"Desktop","3","review","1",,"I booked travel to Hawai’i using Delta  credits from cancelled COVID flights.  I was unable to use the credits to purchase the tickets together in one itinerary.  I’m told there is a way and tried multiple times unsuccessfully.  So the flights were booked separately.  Shortly thereafter, seat changes separated me and my husband for the inbound flight.  I waited on hold 3 hours to speak to a rep who couldn’t undo the change or reassign us to seats together, but she said she “linked the itineraries” so this would not reoccur with the other leg of our travel.  Guess what, it did!!   We were separated again on the return flight. Three hours on hold for nothing, nada, zip.  I am not a happy first class customer.
